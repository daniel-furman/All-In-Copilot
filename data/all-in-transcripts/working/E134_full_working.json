    "17:54 - 17:59": "an area they can test but it's not technically a fortified line the ukrainians are still in that sort of",

    "18:22 - 18:29": "things called Dragon Teeth which are concrete bollards that stop tanks or move them in a certain direction then",
    "18:29 - 18:35": "the Russians have massive amounts of artillery they've got infantry on the ground that helps spot the artillery and",

    "20:48 - 20:53": "evidence for it in a second but yeah what the deal would have provided is that the Russians would move back to",
    "20:53 - 20:59": "pre-war lines if the ukrainians would agree not to become a member of NATO",
    "20:59 - 21:08": "however the ukrainians could still receive specified security guarantees from the West that was the deal now well",

    "21:13 - 21:21": "it was rejected by the West you also have now Putin showing the very document which was signed by the Ukrainian",
    "21:21 - 21:26": "delegation so this was the definition of the document right nobody else has this document it hasn't been released yet I",
    "21:26 - 21:32": "hope the Russian government releases it for the purpose of History so we can inspect it but nobody contested this",
    "21:32 - 21:37": "document is real remember if he's just making this up you would think that erdogan would basically come forward and",
    "21:37 - 21:44": "say no this is fake there's too many people who are in that room who'd be able to say this document is fake no one has done that so I think there's every",
    "21:44 - 21:49": "reason to believe this document is real now it is not a final agreement it appears to be a preliminary agreement or",
    "21:49 - 21:56": "an outline but the outline is that Russia is saying we will move back to pre-war lines if you agree not become",
    "21:56 - 22:02": "part of NATO and that deal was rejected when Boris Johnson influenta Kiev and",

    "22:07 - 22:13": "that is not the Russians the source for that is a Ukrainian publication called",
    "22:13 - 22:20": "Ukrainian Pravda up and they ran an article in May of 2022 that I can put on",
    "22:20 - 22:27": "the screen and it is the source for saying that Boris Johnson came in and told zielinski we do not want to make a",

    "22:34 - 22:39": "do we will give you Advanced weapon systems and that is when the deal fell apart if you look at the timing of it",
    "22:39 - 22:45": "yes it is this has been lightly sourced here so let's no no no but you have to consider",
    "22:45 - 22:51": "the source here this is a pro-ukrainian publication writing in May of 2022. now",
    "22:51 - 22:58": "the tone of the article and what they basically say in this article is that zielinski accepted Boris Johnson's offer",
    "22:58 - 23:04": "in other words he took the Gamble and at this point in time you've got to remember this is two months after the war started it looked like the",

    "23:11 - 23:16": "deal to pressure Putin rather than make peace now a year later it looks like",
    "23:16 - 23:21": "this gamble was a disaster yeah and so that is the real conclusion here a deal",
    "23:21 - 23:27": "was available but the West chose not to take it by the way Fiona Hill who is a",
    "23:27 - 23:34": "Russia Hawk and you could almost put her I'd say neocon adjacent has basically",
    "23:34 - 23:40": "said that this type of deal was available the West did not want this deal I think Jason may be to give you an",
    "23:40 - 23:46": "answer my thought is that this week was a very bad week for establishment politics and",
    "23:46 - 23:51": "institutions because on the one hand if you take the Russia incident and the Ukraine war what",
    "23:51 - 23:57": "you saw was that there were ample numbers of off-ramps that we chose",

    "24:02 - 24:09": "war on the hopes that it just depletes their resources that's",
    "24:09 - 24:16": "kind of rolling the dice I think in a very dangerous way I think this week we also saw some published stuff on kovid",
    "24:16 - 24:21": "and the covet vaccine which also debunked a lot of widely held truths and it",
    "24:21 - 24:27": "turned out that folks that may have been conspiracy theorists quote unquote were right there as well",
    "24:27 - 24:33": "so I think it's just an uncomfortable set of facts that again just reinforce that if you're not really thinking for",
    "24:33 - 24:39": "yourself you're not going to see the totality of what's actually going on I think with respect to Russia Ukraine",
    "24:39 - 24:45": "everybody has moved on and so sadly the only people that are",

    "24:50 - 24:56": "their families there's the people that are dying there was an article I think today they recruit prisoners right so",

    "25:14 - 25:20": "we didn't take the offering if in fact it's real so I just want to keep putting that disclaimer out there because Putin",
    "25:20 - 25:29": "flashing her back and it doesn't make all this true uh it doesn't mean it's not true well Jason I would say I am just being",
    "25:29 - 25:35": "clear here that none of this is confirmed data points do you need I would say what are you talking about enough tolly Bennett confirmed it what",
    "25:35 - 25:41": "incentives the Israeli former Israeli leader have to lie about this here's what I would say Jason I think that",
    "25:41 - 25:49": "something like that is so profoundly important that if it were not true I",
    "25:49 - 25:55": "think it would have been very important for the powers that be to discredited almost immediately",
    "25:55 - 26:02": "so that they didn't have to look like they were warmongering unnecessarily can I also up",
    "26:02 - 26:07": "level and connect to this point about the establishment because I think",
    "26:07 - 26:13": "there's been a lot of pushback to even challenging the status quo even having a",
    "26:13 - 26:19": "conversation about Ukraine or having a conversation about coven and I think if",
    "26:19 - 26:25": "there's one thing this pod represents the fight going on at Twitter represents is the need",
    "26:25 - 26:30": "to have this conversation if we look at the wars the U.S has engaged in since",
    "26:30 - 26:35": "September 11th it's estimated three to four million people",

    "27:09 - 27:15": "points tell me at a very minimum we need more of this discussion more of this",
    "27:15 - 27:22": "debate not less the idea that that we could be tiptoeing closer and closer to some land war in Europe unnecessarily",
    "27:22 - 27:28": "and I think the bigger issue is and you can't trust what you're being told and I",
    "27:28 - 27:33": "think that that's what's very problem that is a bigger picture and just so we're clear here I'm not saying I'm on",
    "27:33 - 27:39": "either side of this I'm just pointing out that this is all still very thinly sourced no it's not until the West",
    "27:39 - 27:47": "confirms any of this and they expect the West to do you expect the state department to issue a press release saying yup we [ __ ] up it's on me my",
    "27:47 - 27:52": "theories has been I and I've been very clear on",
    "27:52 - 27:58": "this podcast my theory has been since the beginning they want to deplete Russia and they want to deplete their",
    "27:58 - 28:06": "army capabilities and have regime change in Putin I'm not saying I'm for that just for the people",
    "28:06 - 28:11": "Putin that was the crude language what they that is what they plan on doing yes",
    "28:11 - 28:18": "I think that's what they're doing and I think Floyd Austin our secretary of defense said that our purpose was to weaken Russia so to knock it out",
    "28:18 - 28:23": "yes but I think they want regime change yes that's what Boris Johnson went to Kevin said we want to pressure Putin not",
    "28:23 - 28:30": "make a deal with him so they courted this war they they prefer that's been my Fury they prefer to fight a problem of",
    "28:30 - 28:46": "choice",
    "28:46 - 28:52": "that was not my position I actually agree with you if you're saying that that was our government's",
    "28:52 - 28:57": "objective which was to weaken Putin I agree with you they've chose to fight",
    "28:57 - 29:03": "an optional proxy war of choice that was easily avoidable if they just taking NATO expansion off the table because",
    "29:03 - 29:09": "they thought it would weaken Putin but here's the rub on this it has not weakened Putin and is weak in the United",
    "29:09 - 29:17": "States and our allies any way you want to look at this thing look at just the weapons and Munitions so we are out of",
    "29:17 - 29:25": "155 millimeter artillery shells we cannot produce enough this is the crazy thing we spent 800 billion a year plus",
    "29:25 - 29:31": "on the Pentagon in our National Defense we're out of ammo I mean we must be getting so royally ripped off by the",
    "29:31 - 29:37": "military industrial complex okay we cannot produce ammo fast enough that's why Ukraine's losing this war the",
    "29:37 - 29:44": "balance of artillery favors Russia Russia is basically using about 20 000 shells a day the ukrainians are using",
    "29:44 - 29:51": "somewhere between three and six thousand we are out of ammo we cannot produce enough and this um actually dovetails",
    "29:51 - 29:56": "nicely with another story this week there is a journalist named Matt",
    "29:56 - 30:01": "Iglesias is that is how you pronounce his name exactly yeah Iglesias and he",
    "30:01 - 30:07": "said I mean he literally said the quiet part out loud and I'll just quote",
    "30:07 - 30:13": "because he was criticizing you and chamoth uh for hosting RFK we'll",
    "30:13 - 30:18": "get to that in a second but he basically said this is actually a really good idea for us basically NATO",
    "30:18 - 30:24": "Equipment Plus Ukrainian lives are being traded for Russian equipment and Russian lives which leaves NATO coming out ahead",
    "30:24 - 30:31": "that's doubly true because NATO is much richer than Russia so we win a long-term game of everyone explode their weapons",
    "30:31 - 30:38": "as fast as they can make them again though what makes that really true is NATO material is killing Russian",
    "30:38 - 30:44": "soldiers while Russian material is killing Ukrainian soldiers that's a deal in our favor I mean that is a cynical",
    "30:44 - 30:49": "summary of that yeah he wrote that last year in defense of the war basically",
    "30:49 - 30:54": "like all the neocons you serve an establishment approved intellectual they think he's smart I think he's really",
    "30:54 - 31:00": "foolish he basically wants to fight the last Ukrainian here for the sole purpose of blowing up Russia's stockpiles the",
    "31:00 - 31:07": "reason this is so dumb is Russia can always make more those lives aren't coming back but they can always produce more artillery more weapons and in fact",
    "31:07 - 31:13": "the Russian war machine is now ramping up to full production okay they are",
    "31:13 - 31:20": "ramping up the number of people in their army I think it's estimated that by the end of the year they're gonna have 750 000 men under arms they've ramped up",
    "31:20 - 31:25": "artillery shells production they're at something like one and a half million at the beginning of the war we were only",
    "31:25 - 31:31": "producing 14 000 artillery shells a month mostly for training purposes in the United States we've since ramped",
    "31:31 - 31:37": "that up to 20 000 but that's still massively Trails what the Russians can do and they're trying to hold on they're",
    "31:37 - 31:42": "trying to ramp it up to 90 000 a month but that's going to take till 2028 because you know it takes time to build",
    "31:42 - 31:49": "you got to build up new factories new production lines you got to issue contracts to suppliers or vendors it",
    "31:49 - 31:55": "takes time to do this ramped up their War Machine and then the other thing that's happened is that",
    "31:55 - 32:01": "Russia and China have entered a de facto Alliance and including Iran so you now",
    "32:01 - 32:08": "have the cementing of this giant Alliance in Asia between China Russia",
    "32:08 - 32:13": "and Iran they're sharing equipment now together Iran is producing drones for",
    "32:13 - 32:20": "Russia Russia is now going to be giving advanced fighter jets to Iran so this idea that this war has made the West",
    "32:20 - 32:27": "Stronger is depleting the West over an objective we didn't need to fight the war was easily avoidable and we have now",
    "32:27 - 32:32": "created I think the most fearsome opponent that America has ever faced we",
    "32:32 - 32:39": "have never faced a adversary with a combined manufacturing capacity and raw",
    "32:39 - 32:44": "materials of China Russia and Iran if we were to get in a war a new world war",
    "32:44 - 32:50": "against this sort of new axis we could lose they actually have more manufacturing capacity to produce",
    "32:50 - 32:56": "weapons of war and Munitions and ammo then the United States does China has been clear that they're not going to",
    "32:56 - 33:02": "provide weapons to Russia and so I'm not sure that that Alliance",
    "33:02 - 33:08": "is exactly accurate they've given us no such Assurance all they've said is they haven't done it yet it's a theoretical",
    "33:08 - 33:13": "thing that you're talking about here that could be very serious I think your point and this is to Brad's point we should be having a very thoughtful",
    "33:13 - 33:19": "discussion here because if China did pick Russia which they haven't and they went to war it would be",
    "33:25 - 33:32": "just went to China and this was the first trip for an American Secretary of State",
    "33:32 - 33:39": "since 2018 obviously things have been strained with the Spy balloon and the visits to",
    "33:39 - 33:46": "Taiwan Lincoln gave some basic goals for this engagement with China the fentanyl",
    "33:46 - 33:51": "problem some detained Americans and protecting U.S citizens working in China those were",
    "33:51 - 33:59": "kind of the easy check boxes but they wanted to create also an open",
    "33:59 - 34:04": "line of communication between our militaries which China wasn't super",
    "34:04 - 34:10": "stoked on or wouldn't agree to Tony did a great job yeah okay I think what's",
    "34:10 - 34:17": "really disappointing is that while Tony's over there doing this hard work which must be tough to do because it must have been a little bit like",
    "34:17 - 34:24": "dancing on eggshells a little bit right he had to be it's intense yeah he had to be very thoughtful very measured",
    "34:24 - 34:31": "but as far as I could tell he did a fabulous job now full disclosure he's a friend of mine so maybe I'm biased but",
    "34:31 - 34:36": "then over here Biden at some mid-level fundraiser in California is calling XI a",
    "34:36 - 34:42": "dictator how hard must it be for you to try to do your job when your boss is just like",
    "34:42 - 34:48": "completely undisciplined like here and here's the problem with that is that if the United States actually thought",
    "34:48 - 34:54": "that g was a dictator do you think that a mid-level fundraiser that we were all invited to in Northern California that",
    "34:54 - 35:00": "none of us said yes to is the place to announce a foreign policy shift like that absolutely not so it just means",
    "35:00 - 35:05": "that again there's just more evidence about Biden being very undisciplined now",
    "35:05 - 35:12": "again that could be an age issue it could be a mental acuity issue we don't know because we're not given a chance to",
    "35:12 - 35:18": "really prosecute that problem meanwhile Tony's there trying to do the best job he can and the Sands shift underneath",
    "35:18 - 35:24": "him thank God he was able to get the trip done before this thing happened is what I think but that Gap was a very big",
    "35:24 - 35:29": "gap and a very big problem I think because whatever Goodwill he built up",
    "35:29 - 35:38": "was practically flushed on the toilet if you saw the reaction from the Chinese which was to be deeply offended",
    "35:38 - 35:45": "when he went to see NBS and they had to negotiate a fist bump versus a handshake like what is all of this either",
    "35:45 - 35:50": "unplanned or undisciplined theater why are we engaging in any of this stuff",
    "35:50 - 35:55": "it doesn't make any sense Joe Biden's always been known for being a liability",
    "35:55 - 36:02": "in terms of these statements when he worked for Obama he was the VP he also said things you know he shot from the",
    "36:02 - 36:07": "hip a lot you should not be calling him a dictator when you're trying to do this critical work it's a stupid move I think",
    "36:07 - 36:13": "everybody can agree you were gonna say something Brad yeah I was just going to say you know kind of",
    "36:13 - 36:19": "Market reaction going in so the K web the Chinese index was up about 20 heading into these series of meetings",
    "36:19 - 36:26": "now notably blinken was not scheduled to have a meeting was she",
    "36:26 - 36:31": "and so what happened is on day one there's a meeting with the foreign minister",
    "36:31 - 36:37": "right and it seems that there was some positive trend lines coming out of these first two meetings with the top Diplomat",
    "36:37 - 36:43": "with foreign minister which led to the meeting and notably in the meeting he did say the United States has not",
    "36:43 - 36:50": "changed his policy on Taiwan we don't support Taiwanese Independence now the market reaction post visit was",
    "36:50 - 36:57": "down 10 percent and I think this is owing to what shamas said that people felt like maybe we took a step",
    "36:57 - 37:03": "forward here that we at least had a meeting but then it was a another step back",
    "37:03 - 37:08": "and so I think where we sit at the moment is they're probably going to be some follow-on meetings coming out of",
    "37:08 - 37:14": "this this was not you know a a path back to where we were but I think it was a",
    "37:14 - 37:21": "stabilizing moment and you know again we were just at the East Meets West Conference where there",
    "37:21 - 37:27": "are a lot of Chinese CEOs and Founders who were there and I think the idea there was like things are stable like",
    "37:27 - 37:34": "not getting worse and by the way six months ago there was a real concern that things were deteriorating quickly so I",
    "37:34 - 37:39": "think it's you know you can see something constructive coming out of this not getting worse was how I felt",
    "37:39 - 37:45": "coming out of it and then Biden then makes it worse is it really it is a I agree it's just a stupid Gaff let me",
    "37:45 - 37:50": "tell you about some of the reporting from the the Chinese side so after these diplomatic events and and you're right",
    "37:50 - 37:56": "blinken met with Wang Yi for seven hours then he got an audience with Xi Jinping",
    "37:56 - 38:03": "they do these readouts where each side basically produces a public summary of the meeting in the Chinese readout they",
    "38:03 - 38:08": "said that U.S Chinese relationships are at the lowest point they've ever been",
    "38:08 - 38:15": "I mean since I guess diplomatic relations were kind of re-established under Nixon so that from the Chinese",
    "38:15 - 38:22": "standpoint they believe that relationships aren't the worst they've ever been moreover",
    "38:22 - 38:27": "the U.S sought to put Ukraine on the agenda the Chinese response to that was",
    "38:27 - 38:33": "we are not interested in discussing our relationship with Russia that is none of your business",
    "38:33 - 38:38": "so this idea there's been this neocon fantasy that somehow China would help us",
    "38:38 - 38:45": "in this war between Russia and Ukraine and I've said all along that the last thing China wants is for neoconso",
    "38:45 - 38:50": "achieve their objectives with respect to Russia because then China alone will be",
    "38:50 - 38:56": "in the gun sites of U.S Hawks so China will do what it has to do to support and",
    "38:56 - 39:03": "even prop up Russia if they have to remember China and and Russia and",
    "39:03 - 39:08": "specifically she and Putin they are the two leaders who've met with each other more often than any other leader and",
    "39:08 - 39:15": "they've called each other their best friends or most I think the language they used was most Muslims well most",
    "39:15 - 39:20": "bosom friends was what they called it okay that's a little weird buddies yeah but yeah awesome bought a great TV show",
    "39:20 - 39:26": "good point yeah exactly just to give people exactly what happened Biden when he was at this campaign",
    "39:26 - 39:31": "fundraiser in NorCal that uh again yeah we were probably invited to people on the show",
    "39:31 - 39:36": "he was talking about the military Chinese spy balloon and he said she got",
    "39:36 - 39:43": "very upset quote that this was a great embarrassment for dictators when they don't know what happened and he",
    "39:43 - 39:49": "continued to say that she didn't know the balloon had been over the continental U.S and was off course near Alaska and this is the kind of thing",
    "39:49 - 39:54": "where he's basically saying she is stupid or you know whatever or there's",
    "39:54 - 39:59": "some level of incompetence over there it's exactly the wrong message you want to send clung of a dictator and calling",
    "39:59 - 40:05": "him stupid and saying he was embarrassed like why would you provoke that to raise money or to be a tough guy it makes no",
    "40:05 - 40:11": "sense I mean it sounds like Trump's version of foreign they thought the whole balloon thing was a travesty I",
    "40:11 - 40:19": "mean I don't know what the truth of it is but they feel like it was just this continuous uh drumming up of outrage on",
    "40:19 - 40:25": "the American side against China and they wanted to put that behind us in terms of",

    "1:19:45 - 1:19:53": "that were in the you know misnamed inflation reduction act it is like the biggest Bonanza of all time he said that",

    "1:20:05 - 1:20:11": "that it would ultimately cost the government somewhere around a trillion because the way these subsidies work is",
    "1:20:11 - 1:20:17": "that you just qualify for them and then you get the subsidy it's not like the credits run out so if you qualify you",
    "1:20:17 - 1:20:22": "get it so this could end up costing the government way more than than it was originally projected and so the question",
    "1:20:22 - 1:20:28": "is what are you going to get for all this money and in this article on Ford they were talking about these seven",
    "1:20:28 - 1:20:34": "thousand jobs they're being created at a cost of 440 000 per job",

    "1:20:52 - 1:20:58": "thousand what do you do I'm just quoting that paragraph for the article so yeah so the job creation is good but you got",
    "1:20:58 - 1:21:05": "to look at the efficiency of the job creation the other thing is the question I would ask you guys actually is who wants one",
    "1:21:05 - 1:21:10": "of these Ford EVs do you want an EV by Ford um I think there are a lot of people",
    "1:21:10 - 1:21:15": "that drive a Ford pickup truck we talked about this before Saturday's",

    "1:22:19 - 1:22:25": "think there are a lot of people that'll buy it my problem with industrial policy is this you think about that EV Summit that the White House did they didn't",
    "1:22:25 - 1:22:31": "even invite Elon and that that was for political reasons Union reasons yeah partly because of his views on speech",
    "1:22:31 - 1:22:36": "but I think mostly because he's not a union shop right and so that's the real",
    "1:22:36 - 1:22:41": "reason why Ford is being doled out this sort of nine point something billion",

    "1:22:47 - 1:22:53": "and that's the problem with industrial policy is that the money gets handed out by government to the politically",

    "1:23:24 - 1:23:30": "so the question is like what is this portfolio going to look like is there really going to be another Elon in there",
    "1:23:30 - 1:23:36": "because if not there's going to be a lot of cylinders but even if they break even there's gonna be a lot of subsidies to",
