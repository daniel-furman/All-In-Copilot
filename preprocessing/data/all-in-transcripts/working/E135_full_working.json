    "4:20 - 4:26": "you're right that this Rebellion took place just after we dropped our last",
    "4:26 - 4:31": "episode and so everybody both on Twitter and in the comments was dunking on me",
    "4:31 - 4:38": "for my take on last week's episode that the much hyped Ukrainian counter-offensive was was not succeeding",
    "4:38 - 4:44": "that it was in fact failing I think there's abundant evidence for that which hasn't changed even CNN had written an",
    "4:44 - 4:50": "article basically supporting the idea that the counter-offensive was not living up to what had been promised and",
    "4:50 - 4:57": "so everyone was in the comments saying that my take had basically aged like milk and this armed Rebellion or Mutiny",
    "4:57 - 5:02": "by fregosian was evidence that the Russian regime was about to collapse that Russia was",
    "5:02 - 5:08": "in fact on the verge of Civil War and you saw the exact same people who had",
    "5:08 - 5:15": "oversold the counter-offensive now overselling this Mutiny as something that would bring down the Russian",
    "5:15 - 5:21": "regime and and the war and of course that that did not happen it was certainly a highly unusual event",
    "5:21 - 5:26": "and I've read takes now from every different corner of the internet about what it was and what took place you have",
    "5:26 - 5:32": "people speculating that this is all staged I do not believe that I do believe that it was an Insurrection or",
    "5:32 - 5:40": "Mutiny by progosian I think the trigger for it was the fact that his Wagner organization was being merged in with",
    "5:40 - 5:46": "the ministry of defense and the regular Russian army and his men were all being made to sign contracts with the ministry",
    "5:46 - 5:53": "of defense that would have resulted in a giant loss of income and status for pregosian simultaneously for months now",
    "5:53 - 6:00": "he's been criticizing the ministry of Defense specifically the the minister of defense shoigu and the",
    "6:00 - 6:06": "Chief general of the general staff gerasimov so he's been vocally critical",
    "6:06 - 6:13": "of them and I think that this basically erupted into a mutiny by him where he",
    "6:13 - 6:18": "basically tried to leverage his position like you said he marched what they now",
    "6:18 - 6:24": "think are about 8 000 men which is about a quarter of Wagner into rostov on Don",
    "6:24 - 6:31": "he then took the ministry headquarters and sent about three thousand of his men on a convoy to Moscow I think that",
    "6:31 - 6:38": "although this is probably best described as a mutiny I think that it did have coup optionality to it I think that",
    "6:38 - 6:44": "pagosian was seeking to find out how much support Putin had and who might",
    "6:44 - 6:49": "join him and he had put out a number of statements that I think from the Russian regime's point of view could be",
    "6:49 - 6:56": "described as seditious that morning and he there's a lot of evidence that he staged this attack on",
    "6:56 - 7:01": "his base he claimed that there was a missile attack by the ministry of defense and that's what launched this",
    "7:01 - 7:07": "March for justice and in his comments he was careful not to criticize Putin",
    "7:07 - 7:12": "directly but he had a lot to say about Ministry defense and the overall conduct of the war and it was I think harshly",
    "7:12 - 7:18": "critical indirectly of of Putin and I think he was looking to see who might support him",
    "7:18 - 7:24": "and what happened is that on the way to Moscow during this Convoy nobody",
    "7:24 - 7:31": "supported him in fact all the statements came out from the other generals including sir vegan including all the",
    "7:31 - 7:37": "regional governors of members of the Duma and other important figures in Russian society and",
    "7:37 - 7:43": "there wasn't a single person willing to publicly support for Goshen and that's when Putin went on TV called this",
    "7:43 - 7:49": "basically an act of treason and a stab in the back and at that point I think progressions options were pretty limited",
    "7:49 - 7:58": "and he basically took a deal that was brokered by lukashenko in which he would go into Exile in Belarus in",
    "7:58 - 8:04": "exchange for basically being allowed to live that was basically the deal that was ultimately cut and so I think where",
    "8:04 - 8:11": "things stand today is that although I think this was an embarrassment and a black eye for the Russian regime it",
    "8:11 - 8:17": "never looks good for regime to have any kind of mutiny or insurrection",
    "8:17 - 8:22": "and I think that it does raise questions that poon's now gonna have to answer to",
    "8:22 - 8:29": "his various allies and supporters about how stable his regime is I think ultimately Putin has ended up in a place",
    "8:29 - 8:37": "of consolidating Russian Society behind him like I said there were no power centers that supported this Mutiny they",
    "8:37 - 8:43": "all rallied to Putin's defense and the people of Russia even though Ferguson is a popular figure being kind of a war",
    "8:43 - 8:50": "hero from the Battle of bakmut the the Russian Society supported Putin I think he's at something like 80 percent poll",
    "8:50 - 8:55": "numbers so I think where are things well like Lovato Center which is an",
    "8:55 - 9:02": "independent polling Agency for example these are not the Russian regime's own numbers would you say in a poll that you",
    "9:02 - 9:09": "don't support Putin well I don't know how levada Center what their methodology is but these numbers",
    "9:09 - 9:15": "when the numbers are bad are cited by Western sources but there are other forms of evidence too you may have seen",
    "9:15 - 9:23": "this video that went viral over the past few days of this song that's now the number one chart Buster in in Russia",
    "9:23 - 9:29": "where it's this very patriotic Russian song where they're basically singing I am Russian that's sort of the main",
    "9:29 - 9:37": "chorus Nick can you pull up the song I'd like to see this please coming at you 95.5 I love Russia oh my God this is",
    "9:37 - 9:42": "some serious propaganda wow yeah",
    "9:42 - 9:50": "[Music] yeah I mean that looks like a pretty good party",
    "9:50 - 9:57": "if you look up the the lyrics to the song the English translation of the lyrics the gist of it is I I'm basically",
    "9:57 - 10:04": "proud to be a Russian and I don't care who doesn't like it that's basically the the lyrics of it how do you get invited",
    "10:04 - 10:10": "to that party I got so many jokes I'm not gonna make them I know you gotta be careful be",
    "10:10 - 10:15": "careful here folks you gotta be careful here why it looks like a fun party it's a catchy song",
    "10:15 - 10:22": "I mean I love to dress up and show up tell me where to show up Putin I think the point here is that Russian Society",
    "10:22 - 10:28": "is United behind the state and wanting to fight this war and I think that part",
    "10:28 - 10:33": "of the reason why Ferguson's Mutiny was so oversold as an imminent coup that",
    "10:33 - 10:39": "would bring about the collapse of the Putin regime and of the Russian war effort and of their front line is",
    "10:39 - 10:46": "because at least since the beginning of this war we've had this narrative that if we applied enough pressure to Russia",
    "10:46 - 10:51": "that there'd be a palace Intrigue and a palace coup and that liberal forces",
    "10:51 - 10:57": "inside of Russia would rise up and topple the dictator Putin and basically get them out of this war and I think",
    "10:57 - 11:02": "what's happened is fairly predictable but it's the opposite of that which is the Russian people are rallying around",
    "11:02 - 11:09": "the flag and rallying around Putin the war leader and they are a patriotic people just like the ukrainians and I",
    "11:09 - 11:15": "think both these countries that both the Russians and the ukrainians are proud people and I think they're in a fight to",
    "11:15 - 11:22": "the death and I think that both countries okay regardless as existential and we have basically stuck ourselves in",
    "11:22 - 11:27": "the middle of this fight to the death between these two countries and I don't see this working out very well okay so",
    "11:27 - 11:35": "look I I will make an admission I consider myself a modestly well-read person modestly well-informed I had",
    "11:35 - 11:42": "never heard of the Wagner group or pregosian prior to this coup attempt last week Jay Cal had you guys heard of",
    "11:42 - 11:48": "this person before and the Wagner group yeah yeah",
    "11:48 - 11:53": "oh well maybe I'm an idiot or I'm just not interested I think what was so surprising was like how out of the blue",
    "11:53 - 12:00": "the story seemed to be last week that there was this disagreement between this person that commanded this paramilitary",
    "12:00 - 12:06": "organization who then turned around against Putin and stood up against him and marched back towards Moscow and it",
    "12:06 - 12:13": "felt to me like it came a little bit out of the blue and was such like a a weird kind of shocking event did it feel kind",
    "12:13 - 12:20": "of like that to you guys that there was surprising instability and the surprising potential Revolution",
    "12:20 - 12:26": "happening locally I think stepping back here and just looking at the news cycle obviously it I don't think many people",
    "12:26 - 12:33": "expected this this was a wild card and so people could be humble in you know their belief of like how much they",
    "12:33 - 12:39": "actually understand about what's going on there the Russian soldiers are not in favor of this war this is a war that's very",
    "12:39 - 12:45": "unpopular in Russia actually and for the Ukraine having been invaded by Russia they're fighting for their land and",
    "12:45 - 12:51": "they're gonna they are much more motivated I wouldn't believe any of this propaganda but this is a bit of a raw shock test everybody on the left got on",
    "12:51 - 12:57": "Twitter and said this is the end of Putin everybody's gonna rise up in the streets and they overplayed that you",
    "12:57 - 13:04": "know angle of the story and then of course the right or people who are pro-russian or anti the West backing",
    "13:04 - 13:11": "this war are going to take the other side Freeburg they're going to take the side of you know oh everybody loves Russia 80 of",
    "13:11 - 13:17": "people are voting for this it's ridiculous to think that anybody in Russia is going to answer do you like Putin do you support Putin",
    "13:17 - 13:24": "on a survey can you imagine a Putin's a murderous dictator who kills all of his enemies and he controls through violence",
    "13:24 - 13:31": "nobody's answering a survey correctly this you know top song is complete propaganda Putin has control of the",
    "13:31 - 13:37": "entire media apparatus there with this showed actually if you step back and you look at you go to the party",
    "13:37 - 13:44": "though if you were invited well I mean are there going to be potential LPS there last week",
    "13:44 - 13:49": "it's just a joke folks but stepping back if you look at modern day dictators they",
    "13:49 - 13:57": "tend to stay in power for about three decades Putin's in his third and uh I think we're gonna see in uh the",
    "13:57 - 14:03": "next 10 years Putin lose power and he's going to be out of power",
    "14:03 - 14:10": "and when we look back on it it's going to be one of two causes it's going to be either cancer which you know the speculation is has had cancer and that's",
    "14:10 - 14:17": "why he disappears from View because he might be getting treatment and we'll look back on us that the end",
    "14:17 - 14:24": "of his power will be and his control of Russia which he controlling these",
    "14:24 - 14:30": "controlling through violence and fear of violence the threat of violence is exhausting you have to be paranoid and",
    "14:30 - 14:37": "that's why it generally doesn't last that long especially compared to the west where we have a democracy and people last about a half decade",
    "14:37 - 14:44": "he will will look back on his end which will be in the next 10 years either through cancer or through his invasion",
    "14:44 - 14:52": "of Ukraine this is the biggest blunder he's ever made and and this is a really crazy sign that somebody would actually",
    "14:52 - 14:58": "attempt or even float a coup is insane he's murdered every single person who",
    "14:58 - 15:05": "has ever even challenges Authority in a minor way the fact that his one of his right hand men",
    "15:05 - 15:13": "this is one of his tight Inner Circle the fact that one of the people in his tight Inner Circle would actually start",
    "15:13 - 15:19": "heading towards Moscow is insane so to say this wasn't a big deal and Putin's",
    "15:19 - 15:27": "you know now Consolidated power and everybody's in the street dancing this is just simply not true I never",
    "15:27 - 15:34": "said it wasn't a big deal I wasn't talking about you I was talking about the mids on Twitter I never mentioned your name I think that um your point J",
    "15:34 - 15:39": "Cal at the beginning that this doesn't really seem to change anyone's point of view on the Outlook your point of view",
    "15:39 - 15:45": "sounds like it's the same as it was a week ago sacked your point of view is probably the same as it was a week ago I",
    "15:45 - 15:51": "think there are a couple of takeaways here first of all they've had polling of opinion in Russia",
    "15:51 - 15:58": "for a long time and like I said when the polls go the way that the Western sources want no one questions their",
    "15:58 - 16:04": "accuracy again I don't know exactly the methodology but levada Center is an independent pollster that Western",
    "16:04 - 16:10": "Publications do trust I hear them repeat it over and over again and you know by",
    "16:10 - 16:16": "their methodology which I assume hasn't changed I think Putin's popularity before the war is around 65 percent now",
    "16:16 - 16:23": "they're showing it at about 83 percent Jason you may not like the war and you know I certainly don't like them nobody",
    "16:23 - 16:29": "likes the war but I I think it is simply a fact that the Russian people have rallied around the flag and they do",
    "16:29 - 16:36": "support this war and and Putin as the leader now I do think he has egg on his",
    "16:36 - 16:42": "face here from this pagosian Uprising in terms of did I see this coming no I didn't have this on my bingo card I don't think anybody else did either",
    "16:42 - 16:47": "however did I know who provision is certainly I mean I've been tracking progosian statements",
    "16:47 - 16:54": "since around February he's been vocally criticizing the ministry of Defense specifically shoigu and jarasimov in",
    "16:54 - 17:01": "increasingly insubordinate and you could argue even seditious ways I'm really kind of surprised in a way that he",
    "17:01 - 17:07": "wasn't dealt with before this and I'm sure that the Kremlin is kicking itself for probably not dealing with it sooner",
    "17:07 - 17:14": "but in terms of why he stole alive I think that Putin had a really tough decision to make about you quash this",
    "17:14 - 17:20": "Rebellion completely which would have led to horrific images of you know",
    "17:20 - 17:27": "violence potentially in Moscow or Russians and Russians killing Russians that might have actually led the the",
    "17:27 - 17:33": "Russian front to question itself or collapse so I think he did the expedient thing which is he cut a deal he got",
    "17:33 - 17:39": "lukashenko to help broker and he cut a deal and I think at the end of the day I think that he made the cool-headed",
    "17:39 - 17:45": "decision that was in his and in Russian interest which was to avoid this to",
    "17:45 - 17:51": "getting to the point of a bloody Insurrection okay any um any point of",
    "17:51 - 17:56": "view shift for you coming out of the pregosian event of the last week on",
    "17:56 - 18:03": "Russia Ukraine I mean I want to know how much he got paid to stop marching towards Moscow yeah I",
    "18:03 - 18:08": "mean it is like I mean it must have been it must have been a lot",
    "18:08 - 18:15": "not bad for a guy that was what Putin's caterer a few years ago right he started a catering business I spent nine years",
    "18:15 - 18:22": "in jail this guy's life been nine years in jail it's like The Sopranos he went to jail for nine years for selling illegal hot dogs or something and all of",
    "18:22 - 18:27": "a sudden I mean I got just paid billions of dollars to basically stop his",
    "18:27 - 18:33": "paramilitary group from taking over one of the largest countries in the world it's the largest I mean nuclear Arsenal in the world yeah",
    "18:33 - 18:39": "just so you know who this guy is I mean he he really is the street Thug that",
    "18:39 - 18:47": "Putin is always accused of being he was a street dog he did go to jail he was one of these guys who came up",
    "18:47 - 18:52": "in Russia as a businessman when to be a businessman you had to be so tough businessmen were getting murdered left",
    "18:52 - 18:59": "and right by gangsters you almost had to be a gangster yourself apparently he made some money in the supermarket chain",
    "18:59 - 19:05": "business and that led him to create a catering business which brought him to Putin's attention and he started",
    "19:05 - 19:11": "catering for the Kremlin he's sometimes called Putin's Chef I don't think he was a chef himself he was the guy who owned",
    "19:11 - 19:17": "he owned the business and then from there he was given the license to create this PMC this private uh military",
    "19:17 - 19:23": "corporation Bogner group he wasn't the only founder of it he had a co-founder who was",
    "19:23 - 19:28": "actually the military man behind it but Wagner became this this group of",
    "19:28 - 19:33": "mercenaries who do all sorts of business in Africa mainly where they are working",
    "19:33 - 19:38": "on behalf of governments there to protect mineral resources or oil",

    "19:44 - 19:50": "comes out I think it's sort of like John Gotti going against Michael Corleone yeah I think that Putin is sort of the",
    "19:50 - 19:57": "very cold right rational guy with everything in his head who's very calculated it doesn't reveal much right",
    "19:57 - 20:03": "more like a Michael Corleone whereas I think that is emotional erratic he's",
    "20:03 - 20:10": "been saying these statements for months here which I don't see how they lose constantly Loose Cannon and the crazy thing though is is that what you saw on",
    "20:10 - 20:16": "Twitter and social media was unrestrained Glee really delirium over",
    "20:16 - 20:21": "the idea that pagosian my topple Putin and become the custodian of Russia's",
    "20:21 - 20:27": "thousands of nuclear weapons yeah and you know so my comment on this whole thing is be careful what you wish for",
    "20:27 - 20:33": "why in the world would Americans want that we'd be jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire you know I've been",
    "20:33 - 20:39": "saying since the beginning of the war that this fantasy that Putin is going to be toppled by a palace goo and you're getting a replacement with navalny or",
    "20:39 - 20:45": "something like that we're going to get Gorbachev 2.0 I said that was always unrealistic and what you're much more",
    "20:45 - 20:51": "likely to end up with is an even worse dictator or possible or a hardliner and",
    "20:51 - 20:57": "I think that is what would happen if Ferguson had taken over I think would have been much worse for the West the final point is what's the takeaway from",
    "20:57 - 21:05": "here is I think this is going to put more pressure on Putin to conduct the war in a more violent way I I know that",
    "21:05 - 21:11": "people already think that the war is horrible and violent but Putin has been criticized by hardliners on his right",
    "21:11 - 21:18": "for basically making the war a special military operation instead of an all-out war and progosian I think expected to",
    "21:18 - 21:25": "find more support among the sort of ultra nationalists in Russia and among the military who have been critical of",
    "21:25 - 21:32": "Putin for waging the war in what they consider to be too half-hearted or an incomplete way they would like to see",
    "21:32 - 21:38": "this declared to be a war they would like to see the full mobilization of Russian society and this is the problem",
    "21:38 - 21:44": "that I see now is that I think Putin already knew but this has to underscore for him that this war is existential for",
    "21:44 - 21:51": "him personally if he loses it's the end of not only his regime but probably his life in Russia and I think he's going to",
    "21:51 - 21:57": "do whatever it takes to win this war and I think you could see now over the next few months a full mobilization in Russia",
    "21:57 - 22:02": "and I think that this could lead us to the next point of escalation in this war that is if this Ukrainian",
    "22:02 - 22:08": "counteroffensive actually is successful on some level right now it is it is not succeeding so there's no reason there's",
    "22:08 - 22:13": "no reason for Putin to do that but if if this counter offensive succeeds you will see the next level of escalation the",
    "22:13 - 22:21": "fact you did a great job stringing six points together I think my key takeaway is which is now 18 points you've made so",
    "22:21 - 22:26": "you can retire for the rest of the show my key takeaway from your series of statements however",
    "22:26 - 22:31": "is an important one which is to watch the potential escalation driven by Putin here",
    "22:31 - 22:37": "any wrap up otherwise I'm going to move forward you know go ahead thinking about this like",
    "22:37 - 22:43": "there's a famous Sun Tzu quote the Supreme Art of War is to subdue the enemy without fighting",
    "22:43 - 22:48": "this is a big mistake and we need to make sure that we don't get into a war",
    "22:48 - 22:55": "with Taiwan and China and China over Taiwan so okay we have to avoid these things and then that's what and I are in",
    "22:55 - 23:00": "alignment Sun Tzu calacanus we heard it here first let's uh move forward with",
    "23:00 - 23:06": "peace I can only hope that the conflict ends soon as I've always said I realized over the last week how little I know",
    "23:06 - 23:12": "about the Russian military conflict with Ukraine and I appreciate",
    "23:18 - 23:24": "1997 fall in 97 and it was the last year that Cal had affirmative action",
    "23:24 - 23:30": "Admissions and I remember at that time there was a big case a guy named Baki",
    "23:30 - 23:36": "was rejected by the University of California Davis Medical School and he alleged reverse discrimination in 1974",
    "23:36 - 23:41": "and sued the University of California and eventually it became a landmark U.S",
    "23:41 - 23:48": "Supreme Court case Regents of the University of California versus Baki and in 1995 the UC Regents voted to",
    "23:48 - 23:54": "eliminate affirmative action so the year that I was at Cal I think was the last year of affirmative action",
    "23:54 - 24:00": "Admissions and it's obviously been a pretty hot topic",
    "24:00 - 24:06": "here in California for the past you know 25 uh 30 years",
    "24:06 - 24:12": "this morning the Supreme Court ruled on two separate cases regarding using race",
    "24:12 - 24:17": "as an admissions criteria in college admissions and the votes were six to",
    "24:17 - 24:23": "three against affirmative action in the University of North Carolina case in six to two against affirmative action in the",
    "24:23 - 24:30": "Harvard case katanji Brown Jackson recused herself because she previously served on Harvard's Board of overseers all the",
    "24:30 - 24:36": "conservative as their you know kind of characterized judges voted to strike down affirmative action and all the as",
    "24:36 - 24:42": "their characterized liberal judges voted to keep it both of these cases were filed in 2014 by a group called students",
    "24:42 - 24:47": "for fair admissions and effectively the court said that at",
    "24:47 - 24:53": "Harvard at UNC the schools were systematically discriminating against Asian Americans in violation of civil",
    "24:53 - 24:59": "rights laws by using uh their race as a as a system for for profiling excluding",
    "24:59 - 25:07": "and trying to be more inclusive of a more diverse and racially diverse set of applicants so tomorrow I'd love",
    "25:07 - 25:13": "your read I guess on the surprise or this was an accept expected case I think",
    "25:13 - 25:18": "Saxon I mentioned this before but I think we both expected this to happen",
    "25:18 - 25:26": "I think it's probably important to maybe set up a more practical explainer",
    "25:26 - 25:32": "Friedberg so Nick if you want to just throw up that image that I just sent you we can sort",
    "25:32 - 25:39": "of explain the Genesis of the lawsuit so what you can see here",
    "25:39 - 25:44": "is admit rates into Harvard by race",
    "25:44 - 25:49": "ethnicity but also by academic decile yeah and so what it basically shows in a",
    "25:49 - 25:55": "nutshell is an African-American student in the 40th percentile of the academic",
    "25:55 - 26:00": "index is actually more likely to get in than an Asian student at the 100th",
    "26:00 - 26:07": "percentile and so that at the core is sort of sorry that means that means that the Asian",
    "26:07 - 26:15": "American student had better scores than 99 of other applicants and still didn't get",
    "26:15 - 26:23": "in right right so you have to go back I think to 2003",
    "26:23 - 26:29": "when essentially what the Supreme Court said is like look we're going to allow this affirmative action stuff to last",
    "26:29 - 26:35": "roughly for another 25 years but by that point we expect that the",
    "26:35 - 26:40": "work that needed to be done will have been done again this is them saying this not me",
    "26:40 - 26:47": "and so I think what today does is actually quite important not just for what it",
    "26:47 - 26:53": "means for universities but also what it means for private Enterprises so just to take a second on",
    "26:53 - 26:58": "this I think what happens today is the pretty obvious stuff which is",
    "26:58 - 27:05": "that you have to change University applications you have to change all of the admissions profiling all of the",
    "27:05 - 27:11": "stuff that you would normally do you probably I'm not even sure if you can even have a box where you can",
    "27:11 - 27:16": "declare race maybe you can or cannot I don't even know but all of that changes today",
    "27:16 - 27:23": "so then the question is well what's the first order derivative what changes next and I called someone who's a pretty well",
    "27:23 - 27:28": "known constitutional supreme court lawyer on this and",
    "27:28 - 27:35": "The Next Step is probably going to be around Athletics based and legacy-based admissions",
    "27:35 - 27:41": "so Athletics based admissions are pretty obvious which is you don't really have great grades",
    "27:41 - 27:48": "but you're really stupendous at a sport that's important to that school so then they let you in because they",
    "27:48 - 27:55": "want to compete inside sport for whatever reason the Legacy one is even more prickly which is not you're kind of a dummy but",
    "27:55 - 28:01": "your parents are rich and or went to the school before and so then they let you in as well",
    "28:01 - 28:07": "and his thought on this is that those things",
    "28:07 - 28:13": "will go away because if you can't use race-based admissions to kind of balance",
    "28:13 - 28:20": "the scales then it'll become pretty quick where somebody launches a legacy-based lawsuit or an athletic",
    "28:20 - 28:26": "based bias lawsuit and wins that as well so that's the first order derivative so",
    "28:26 - 28:35": "you know the thought are those because those aren't constitutionally protected whereas equality based on race",
    "28:35 - 28:42": "but it becomes a huge headache for these schools right and so you're going to be fighting these admission standards constantly",
    "28:42 - 28:48": "changing and so if you're not going to let you know a bunch of poor minority black and brown",
    "28:48 - 28:55": "kids in but you're letting in the Sons and Daughters of Rich important people I",
    "28:55 - 29:01": "think that that's going to paint that school in a very bad light so I think that's so important white typically",
    "29:01 - 29:07": "white typically white although one would say the great thing over the last couple of decades is there have been a lot of",
    "29:07 - 29:14": "minorities that have gotten into these very elite schools which means this their kids would be the first generation",
    "29:14 - 29:21": "that's eligible for legacy but you're gonna wipe that away so I think from a just a social stigma perspective and I",
    "29:21 - 29:27": "have a solution for this which I'll get to at the end for those people but so I think that's the first order derivative the second order derivative is now what",
    "29:27 - 29:34": "lawsuits get launched and what are the implications for private companies right so right now this affects any",
    "29:34 - 29:39": "institution that receives Federal funding and that includes all the universities so there's no private or",
    "29:39 - 29:44": "public university really except for a handful that don't take this money so they'll all have to do this",
    "29:44 - 29:52": "but the really important question after that will be what happens to companies like apple or Facebook or Exxon who have",
    "29:52 - 29:59": "race-based programs to try to attract African-American Engineers or",
    "29:59 - 30:05": "Hispanic chemists whatever whatever the program is that you want to come up with",
    "30:05 - 30:10": "will those get challenged and will those companies have to change and my friends",
    "30:10 - 30:16": "thoughts on that were that yes that those would also change and that's going to have a really important impact on",
    "30:16 - 30:23": "private Enterprise and how they approach this stuff and how Dei stuff works and frankly Downstream how ESG works because",
    "30:23 - 30:30": "all these ESG check boxes now some of them will actually become illegal right so I think the importance of decision",
    "30:30 - 30:36": "can't be really understated it's going to the changes will be slow and then",
    "30:36 - 30:41": "they'll be fast they'll first touch higher ed but then I think they'll touch private Enterprise and so I think it was",
    "30:41 - 30:46": "a it was a very important decision in America that just happened",
    "30:46 - 30:53": "what is what is the right ethics and and values I mean what do you guys I guess we could",
    "30:53 - 30:58": "just do this around the table Jacob maybe you kick it off should we I mean from your point of view",
    "30:58 - 31:06": "do you think that values should include racial diversity in Admissions and",
    "31:06 - 31:12": "universities yeah this is like the ultimate or is the values about equality of opportunity for everyone regardless",
    "31:12 - 31:18": "of race right you're asking the exact right question I think that's the world's greatest moderator but yeah",
    "31:18 - 31:24": "doing a solid job so far and this creates a lot of cognitive dissonance for people right because you you really",
    "31:24 - 31:30": "want to believe that the world is a meritocracy and uh you know if you were to take",
    "31:30 - 31:36": "other Pursuits in the world you'd never say like we should let race gender",
    "31:36 - 31:41": "age affect people's performance in the 100 yard dash or their their",
    "31:41 - 31:48": "compensation at a company right all of that should be based on achievement and so there is a question on what",
    "31:48 - 31:55": "achievements should be taken into account when you apply to a school and it's pretty obvious the Legacy thing",
    "31:55 - 32:02": "you know is you know a back door into these schools but we want to feel like we're also",
    "32:02 - 32:10": "making progress because listen the world has been unfair the world was built on slavery and our",
    "32:10 - 32:15": "country has you know it's only 150 years past that and Civil Rights Act was what",
    "32:15 - 32:20": "1964 or 65 like we've we've we really want to see everybody achieve here so I",
    "32:20 - 32:27": "think you have to pause for a second and say well if the goal is you want to see you know black Americans perform better",
    "32:27 - 32:33": "and I think that's the the underlying concern here",
    "32:33 - 32:41": "and it is based on the legacy of America well how do you do that and I think we're looking way too far down in the",
    "32:41 - 32:46": "educational pipeline the solution here is really Child Care the solution here is Nursery schools",
    "32:46 - 32:53": "pre-k elementary school education and those things need competition and that's where people fall behind to be looking at this",
    "32:53 - 32:58": "at the end of the academic journey is I think crazy so you know when I'm",
    "32:58 - 33:05": "president I'm going to have 365 day a year you know child care and",
    "33:05 - 33:11": "Pre-K and that's where we should if we really want to try to make up for some wrongs in the history of this country",
    "33:11 - 33:16": "and try to have better outcomes we need competition in schools which means probably breaking some of",
    "33:16 - 33:23": "these unions and giving people vouchers and choice and then we have to invest more in the earliest stages of Education",
    "33:23 - 33:29": "and I think everybody wants to see a better system here Dei to chamat's point",
    "33:29 - 33:35": "is it is illegal to hire people based on race gender any of those criteria",
    "33:35 - 33:41": "obviously and the Dai programs are trying to fill more applicants so their",
    "33:41 - 33:46": "goal typically in the way they don't break the law is to just try to in their",
    "33:46 - 33:54": "best cases find more applicants and but even that does feel like there's many",
    "33:54 - 34:00": "times in life when um people will say things in Corporate America like we have too many white guys",
    "34:00 - 34:06": "in this these positions we need we cannot hire another white guy so the reality of Dei that I've seen up close",
    "34:06 - 34:11": "and personal when I was at AOL I've told the story before somebody said to me there's no way for",
    "34:11 - 34:17": "us to make you an EVP you have to stay at SVP and I said why is that like I'm doing all this EVP level work and they",
    "34:17 - 34:24": "said because you're a white guy and the entire company is white guys at EVP and we cannot add another white guy",
    "34:24 - 34:29": "there but we'll just give you the same bonus compensation so don't worry about it and so there's all kinds of games being",
    "34:29 - 34:36": "played here but I think it's great that we're having this conversation right it's a hard conversation for America to have for me the",
    "34:36 - 34:41": "I've talked about this in the past I've always had concern",
    "34:41 - 34:46": "when we make the shift away from equality of opportunity to a quality of",
    "34:46 - 34:52": "outcome because we all have this objective that we want to see everyone have equal",
    "34:52 - 34:57": "rights to success in some way in the United States the question is at what",
    "34:57 - 35:04": "point do you move Beyond opportunity where everyone is given an equal opportunity in this country",
    "35:04 - 35:10": "to invest themselves in transforming their own lives versus a",
    "35:10 - 35:17": "quality of outcome where regardless of how much you do how much effort or",
    "35:17 - 35:22": "your trials you were given the same as everyone else and that ends up looking a lot like socialism and it's very",
    "35:22 - 35:28": "concerning because I think it limits progress and opportunity for everyone the real challenge with this particular",
    "35:28 - 35:34": "topic is college admissions about outcome or is about opportunity",
    "35:34 - 35:39": "it's outcome in the sense that you spend 12 years going to elementary school and",
    "35:39 - 35:44": "high school and working hard to get yourself into college so it's the outcome of all of that",
    "35:44 - 35:52": "effort and some people aren't given the opportunity to have success during those 12 years and you know",
    "35:52 - 35:58": "and it is an outcome what do you think we should do and it's an opportunity because it's about going to college because without having a great College",
    "35:58 - 36:04": "cycle you may have a more tougher time getting into a into the workforce so it that is why it's a hard value question",
    "36:04 - 36:11": "for me I I don't have a great answer on this but I'm just pointing out it's a lot like the abortion argument where both",
    "36:11 - 36:16": "sides have some value-oriented point of view that feels",
    "36:16 - 36:22": "like it's negating the other person's point of view but at the end of the day they're both coming from either this is an",
    "36:22 - 36:27": "opportunity or it's an outcome decision and that's what makes it so challenging the National Bureau of economic research",
    "36:27 - 36:35": "did a study in 2019 that they published and what they found was that 43 so 4 3",
    "36:35 - 36:41": "43 of white students admitted to Harvard were athletes",
    "36:41 - 36:48": "or Legacy students or children of faculty and staff or had a relative that",
    "36:48 - 36:53": "were donors to the school 43 wait it's rigged and then they found",
    "36:53 - 36:58": "on top of that that 75 of those white students admitted from those four",
    "36:58 - 37:05": "categories would have been rejected if they had been treated as a normal applicant so I think for all the people",
    "37:05 - 37:12": "that are looking at all the black and brown kids that may not get into a place like Harvard if you don't look at these other",
    "37:12 - 37:17": "categories it is a it's a bit of a gross Injustice quite honestly so I think that these",
    "37:17 - 37:23": "institutions have to evolve and if you're going to be forced to be meritocratic then actually be",
    "37:23 - 37:28": "meritocratic and by the way I actually am fine with legacies and donors but I",
    "37:28 - 37:34": "think what should happen is you should just publish a rate card and you should make it hyper transparent and so I love",
    "37:34 - 37:40": "it for the rich guy who's got an idiot son or daughter let's just be upfront and honest with everybody it costs 50",
    "37:40 - 37:46": "million dollars to get into Stanford it costs 80 million dollars to get into Harvard we all know these numbers so we",
    "37:46 - 37:52": "should just publish them you should pay the price and be done with it and for Harvard and Stanford and Yale and all",
    "37:52 - 37:57": "these schools having an extra 10 or 20 dummies but an extra two or three billion may be a",
    "37:57 - 38:03": "reasonable trade-off but at least it would be transparent and fair right this is an important free market question as",
    "38:03 - 38:08": "well because these are private institutions they're privately funded not if they take federal dollars or not",
    "38:08 - 38:13": "agreed yes but if they take federal dollars they're not and then it becomes a government processing it's government",
    "38:13 - 38:20": "influence it's a state school all those is there a separate category here just like country clubs or any private",
    "38:20 - 38:26": "membership club where the members of the club get to decide who they want to admit to the club and is that",
    "38:26 - 38:33": "Un-American and should the Supreme Court and should our Constitution have a role in defining how private institutions",
    "38:33 - 38:39": "make decisions about who gets it no Harvard could absolutely return all the federal funding the billions of dollars a year they get that's totally",
    "38:39 - 38:44": "reasonable then they even decide to just focus on Legacy admits that's totally reasonable it's within",
    "38:44 - 38:51": "their rights sacks like we got it I know that I know that you used up your quote your speaking quota already well yeah I",
    "38:51 - 38:56": "didn't want to I didn't want to butt in it give him four on my points you get",
    "38:56 - 39:03": "four of Jake house minutes go ahead so yeah two points I guess so on the Legacy thing I agree with jamas that we",
    "39:03 - 39:08": "should get rid of it it's not meritocratic I think that if they did publish a rate card that would be more",
    "39:08 - 39:13": "honest but they would be too embarrassed and ashamed to do that but I think making that argument exposes the",
    "39:13 - 39:20": "hypocrisy of it I've already told my kids I'm not helping them get into college so they're going to do it on their own and so look",
    "39:20 - 39:27": "I think by the way that's the best gift you can give kids yeah that that perspective sorry go ahead sex so that's",
    "39:27 - 39:32": "that's Point number one fully agreed on on the Legacy thing with respect to the decision itself that I'm sorry can I",
    "39:32 - 39:38": "just clarify that do you believe that the Legacy thing should be like in federal law I mean is that a government",
    "39:38 - 39:44": "thing or do you think that that's how those institutions should behave because those are different I mean I'm asking",
    "39:44 - 39:49": "are you suggesting that the law should be involved that the government should be involved I don't know if it's a legal thing because I don't know how to",
    "39:49 - 39:55": "implement that law but um I think it's something they should stop doing one way or another maybe it should be a law but I think it should stop so I think that's",
    "39:55 - 40:02": "important Legacy thing for privacy for private membership so just let me just double click on that do you think that",
    "40:02 - 40:08": "should extend to private membership clubs like country clubs as well that they shouldn't be allowed to decide who they let in and don't let in what makes",
    "40:08 - 40:17": "it different that it's Harvard is it because it's education versus any other private membership because it takes Federal funding",
    "40:17 - 40:24": "for some person to be able to get into a school they don't deserve to get into just because their parent went there or",
    "40:24 - 40:30": "just because their parents wrote a check that's unreasonable and if they don't take Federal funding these schools take",
    "40:30 - 40:35": "so much Federal funding that they're quasi-public institutions even the private ones so that's the distinction",
    "40:35 - 40:43": "that's the distinction for you just to be clear yeah and also there is a strong meritocracy opportunity argument on this",
    "40:43 - 40:50": "and I think it's why that whole parents College admissions Scandal was was such a big deal is that for a lot of people",

    "42:39 - 42:45": "is still quite unfair in the sense that there are so many black and brown kids I think with tons of potential that don't",
    "42:45 - 42:53": "even get there and so the real question is what are you doing at the grade school and at the high school and at the preschool",
    "42:53 - 43:00": "so that you actually get more of these kids to the starting line because fixing it when they're 18 I think is a little",

    "44:02 - 44:08": "the teachers unions on our public education system and it I I think it's absolutely correct",

    "44:39 - 44:46": "to form unions but what we all do is we are forced to be consumers of one educational product",

    "44:58 - 45:04": "it so there's competition so the unions can have protection but there still should be competition for these services",

    "45:31 - 45:38": "colleges it turns out a lot of the black and brown students they get accepted and they're behind in math and so what smash",
    "45:38 - 45:44": "has done is they have a three-year program and I go speak at it sometimes and I donate money to it and I encourage you",
    "45:44 - 45:49": "to do the same they have this intensive summer program so before you go to college tomorrow if you were one of",

    "46:19 - 46:24": "societies right I'm sure it's not just pick on Harvard but it's like it's like the elite institutions which we talk",
    "46:24 - 46:31": "about institutions okay all institutions that receive federal funding they need to take a deep look in the mirror and say are we doing the best thing for",
    "46:31 - 46:37": "society the second question I had for the panel was well I'm not getting the feeling by the way but yeah but our Pure",
    "46:37 - 46:43": "academics the best way to accept people into a college or should there be some blend of it like putting Sports aside",
    "46:43 - 46:51": "because that's an obvious one but you know is there's academics but then there's also creativity you know if you you might be terrible on your SATs test",

    "46:58 - 47:04": "all want and it feels tremendously unfair my point of view is if the",
    "47:04 - 47:10": "government is funding these schools then the government certainly has to have a point of view on what's the reasonable",
    "47:10 - 47:15": "model for admissions the government's not funding the schools I Love A",

    "47:39 - 47:44": "well you did in math and stem schools don't care whether or not you want an",
    "47:44 - 47:51": "art competition and I think that that's the important thing that we need to preserve we need to preserve optionality",

    "48:11 - 48:16": "out of these systems and give them the freedom to set their own admissions criteria and create differential",
    "48:16 - 48:22": "Educational Systems I think that's going to create the best diversity of a Workforce",
    "48:22 - 48:29": "and I'm I would kind of be more excited about that sort of an Institutional system than one that is",
    "48:29 - 48:35": "standardized by the government you know why that'll never happen because the profit motive of these",
    "48:35 - 48:40": "universities is really to be Shadow organizations for their endowments",
    "48:40 - 48:46": "and the thing with endowments is that the people that work there very much want to",
    "48:46 - 48:52": "get paid and behave like profit generating organizations and I think",
    "48:52 - 48:57": "the issue is that if their sole job was to really fund",
    "48:57 - 49:04": "the operational expenses of the University then the endowments would be run very",
    "49:04 - 49:09": "differently right like take again I just looked up on the internet but Harvard has about",
    "49:09 - 49:16": "the operating expenses are roughly five and a half billion dollars a year but the revenues are about five and a",
    "49:16 - 49:22": "half billion dollars a year right so if instead you had to basically fund you know there was essentially no Revenue",
    "49:22 - 49:27": "per se right there's there is very little tuition and you didn't take any federal funding you'd have to come up",
    "49:27 - 49:34": "with five billion dollars a year so you just basically take that as a draw from your endowment the endowment would",
    "49:34 - 49:40": "be run very differently it would be a don't lose money endowment that would generate",
    "49:40 - 49:47": "very low Vol returns I think the problem with that is that that's not how the endowment at Harvard works",
    "49:47 - 49:52": "they wouldn't necessarily make risk seeking investments in things like private equity and hedge funds and",
    "49:52 - 49:57": "Venture Capital into the extent they did they would just make much much fewer much much smaller or both",
    "49:57 - 50:03": "so I think what you're saying could be possible but the problem are probably the",
    "50:03 - 50:10": "endowments at these universities okay well 53 billion dollars moving Harvard's endowment now so yeah it would be ten",
    "50:10 - 50:16": "percent can anyone tell me who the largest real estate owner is in San Francisco you're not working on the internet oh no",
    "50:16 - 50:23": "I know I know it's that Art Institute The Academy of Art University I knew this because they uh kept buying things",
    "50:23 - 50:28": "and using them I think she used all the profit over the years to buy more real",
    "50:28 - 50:34": "estate and she accumulated the largest real estate portfolio yeah yeah yeah sorry who is she the founder I forgot",
    "50:34 - 50:39": "her name this is a for-profit university or a private or I mean a non-profit",

    "51:36 - 51:43": "valuation for data bricks which was 38 billion dollars from a fundraising that they did in 2021 so arguably the",
    "51:43 - 51:50": "valuation should be lower and the overall purchase price could be considered lower but that's besides the point Mosaic ml as you guys may remember",
    "51:50 - 51:57": "is a company I mentioned a number of episodes ago led by the founder of Nirvana which was",
    "51:57 - 52:02": "an early AI business that was acquired by Intel and then he started Mosaic ML",

    "52:26 - 52:33": "databricks is paying a pretty hefty premium and I think it begs the question what do data infrastructure database",

    "53:08 - 53:14": "it's probably the hottest space right now in in Venture Land we actually looked at this deal we had a small",
    "53:14 - 53:19": "allocation in our next round they had a term sheet for a series B",
    "53:19 - 53:25": "emergence was actually an elite it and this is Mosaic ml yeah yeah I don't know",
    "53:25 - 53:31": "if I'm supposed to be telling you all this but yeah it's not great this is why people see it",
    "53:31 - 53:38": "in breaking news that a term sheet from emergence to raise 50 million at 400",
    "53:38 - 53:43": "posts wow and we yeah and we were gonna have a small allocation in that and as I",
    "53:43 - 53:50": "recall the valuation was somewhere around 30 to 35 times ARR which actually is not that",
    "53:50 - 53:57": "insane for a very fast scoring company in a hot space so that implies about 10 million of ARR I don't remember the",
    "53:57 - 54:03": "exact figure but I think that's sort of the ballpark but growing very very quickly I mean up from like one or two",
    "54:03 - 54:09": "at the beginning of the year right so I actually understand why someone",
    "54:09 - 54:15": "would want to acquire or invest in this company like I said I think we wanted to invest and while we were sort of you",
    "54:15 - 54:21": "know trying our best you didn't say anything when I talked about him on the show a few weeks ago you were just sitting there mum's a word or actually I",
    "54:21 - 54:27": "knew that this deal was was basically in the works because the founder called us up and he had already promised us a",
    "54:27 - 54:33": "small allocation around Naveen did and he called up and said actually I've got this deal so we're",
    "54:33 - 54:40": "putting the round on hold and so I didn't think I should say anything because obviously it was still ongoing",
    "54:40 - 54:47": "but yeah we knew about this deal that was kind of coming down the pipe I didn't know for sure that it would happen but but yeah we we heard it was",
    "54:47 - 54:53": "in the ballpark of this like 1.2 1.3 billion dollar number which like you said because databricks is a private",
    "54:53 - 54:59": "stock maybe it's only 10 or 750 or something like that who knows it's still a great deal but you",
    "54:59 - 55:05": "know a lot of people are saying it's a crazy deal I don't think it's a crazy deal because before this happened after",
    "55:05 - 55:10": "Naveen signed the term sheet for the series B an investor came over the top",
    "55:10 - 55:16": "to invest at a 700 million dollar valuation wow so people were kind of going crazy now I don't think that's",
    "55:16 - 55:23": "necessarily a rational Behavior I think that's more of evidence of a Mania going on but I think that what he got offered",
    "55:23 - 55:30": "is obviously a fantastic deal and I think what it's evidence of is that these big Enterprise infra companies are",
    "55:30 - 55:35": "going to try and build an end-to-end tool chain here and I think Mosaic ml",
    "55:35 - 55:40": "had a very very important part of the tool set which is training up these",
    "55:40 - 55:47": "models basically maximizing GPU efficiency because gpus are basically the scarce item right now we have a GPU",
    "55:47 - 55:54": "shortage and it's probably not going to get better for a year or two if that so this is a very important part of the of",
    "55:54 - 56:01": "the stack and I think it's probably a smart acquisition for both yeah I mean remember snow snowflake which competes",
    "56:01 - 56:07": "with data breaks also acquired Neva which was founded by one of my colleagues a guy I work with uh and a",
    "56:07 - 56:15": "new really great guy sweetheart for 150 million dollars last month that deal was announced and the pattern recognition",
    "56:15 - 56:21": "that seems to emerge here is that if you're in the data infrastructure business it seems like it's becoming",
    "56:21 - 56:28": "critical to level up that it's not just about storing and moving and manipulating data but the interpretation",
    "56:28 - 56:36": "of data through models and the tooling to build those models becomes a critical component think of all of these toolkits",
    "56:36 - 56:42": "that these software companies have to provide to their by software companies and it's a big leveling up that's necessary which seems to me there's",
    "56:42 - 56:47": "other companies out there like them that are also going to need to strap on tools",
    "56:47 - 56:54": "like this to make themselves competitive in this marketscape which means that there are more Acquisitions still to come yeah",
    "56:54 - 57:00": "Jacob you guys agree or have a different point of view looking at it it's a it's",
    "57:00 - 57:05": "a big number the headline number but I agree with Saks that the actual numbers half the number so if it was you know if",
    "57:05 - 57:12": "you look at the number of Engineers they had based on LinkedIn data and pitchbook data probably 60 70 employees 80",
    "57:12 - 57:18": "employees and then 40 50 of them are Engineers so that puts it at 30 million dollars per engineer and that's one way",

    "57:25 - 57:31": "ten million dollars per engineer for like really high-end Engineers is more the going price but if this is half that",
    "57:31 - 57:37": "amount because they bought it with Monopoly money in other words they're 2021 price for their company it's great",

    "57:45 - 57:50": "of any service whether it's something as simple as Yelp or something as",
    "57:50 - 57:56": "complicated as a giant financial company with tons of transaction data being able",

    "58:15 - 58:22": "that's pretty interesting tell me more about our customers and you know how are they reacting to these three new",

    "58:47 - 58:55": "four of them would not have been possible before these machine learning apis were available and open AI is but",
    "58:55 - 59:01": "one there are now in the companies I'm talking to they're they're trialing Freeburg on average six seven eight",

    "59:07 - 59:14": "not possible before this technology was introduced and available via API in the last six to 12 months",
    "59:14 - 59:20": "and I think there's a bunch of businesses that economically would not work that now work I can give one",
    "59:20 - 59:27": "example there are countless meetings that are recorded over uh Zoom right",
    "59:27 - 59:34": "think like a local school board well nobody could ever make a database of all the discussions going on at local",

    "59:40 - 59:46": "uh on zoom and they occur on zoom and they're available for public record you can ingest every single one of those and",

    "59:52 - 59:57": "and do that with chat GPT or any of the language models and then get really",

    "1:00:57 - 1:01:03": "as you guys know was the co-founder of deepmind which Google bought for 400 million dollars really created the core",

    "1:01:40 - 1:01:46": "don't make sense is this still you know kind of reinforce your point and you",
    "1:01:46 - 1:01:53": "know what's your read on on the inflection funding well the list price of an h100 is about 30 odd thousand but",
    "1:01:53 - 1:01:58": "the street price so it's very hard to get it so if you go to the if you go to like eBay and try to buy an h100 it's",
    "1:01:58 - 1:02:04": "like 40 or 45 000. so if you have a 22 000 cluster of",
    "1:02:04 - 1:02:10": "h100s that's about 900 million dollars of capex just that",
    "1:02:10 - 1:02:17": "and then you know all the sundry stuff around it call it roughly plus or minus a billion dollars",
    "1:02:17 - 1:02:24": "and so of the one and a half billion they've raised let's say a billion goes into building this 22 000 node cluster",
    "1:02:24 - 1:02:31": "you have 500 million for SG a and so what that leaves behind is basically two and a half billion of Enterprise value",

    "1:04:06 - 1:04:13": "they use to buy their services and then you know you just you're just pumping Revenue so I hope it works wishing the",
    "1:04:13 - 1:04:18": "best but you know that's the that's what we just talked about where the infrastructure companies that are",

    "1:04:43 - 1:04:49": "that we're seeing in the early stage with some of these businesses I think for sure there's going to be more M A and I think the valuations will be high",
    "1:04:49 - 1:04:54": "not because these companies have a lot of Revenue yet but because it's very strategic for these big infra companies",

    "1:06:44 - 1:06:53": "memo for Mosaic and I think to explain the point you were kind of making Freeburg like why do Enterprises need",
    "1:06:53 - 1:06:59": "the services one really simple way of thinking about it right now is that every Enterprise would like to roll out",
    "1:06:59 - 1:07:05": "its own chat GPT they would all like to have their own internal version of chat GPT where their employees for example",
    "1:07:05 - 1:07:11": "could ask questions and get answers that's where all the action is right now every Enterprise would buy that tomorrow",
    "1:07:11 - 1:07:17": "if it existed in the way sex yeah give an example the idea would",
    "1:07:17 - 1:07:23": "be that you know any employee in the company could ask questions to the AI model the way you can ask chat GPT",
    "1:07:23 - 1:07:30": "questions and it would have all the Enterprises data and it would also understand their permissions and have all the security settings so that only",
    "1:07:30 - 1:07:36": "there I feel could get the right information that's the kind of intelligence they want to unlock I mean there are lots of other use cases but",
    "1:07:36 - 1:07:42": "that's a really simple one a corporate Oracle so I can if I'm in HR I can ask hey tell me about our you know",
    "1:07:42 - 1:07:48": "composition yeah totally co-pilot for the CEO I think there's gonna be lots of these I think the sales team is gonna",
    "1:07:48 - 1:07:54": "have their own co-pilot I think the marketing team's gonna have their own co-pilot and customer support has it already yeah this customer support will",
    "1:07:54 - 1:08:00": "have it there's gonna be a lot of these but I think Enterprises want one at the level",
    "1:08:00 - 1:08:06": "of the call it the company intranet where employees could just ask it questions and but they do not want to",
    "1:08:06 - 1:08:12": "share their data with open AI That's like very clear they want to roll out their own models so the question is well how do you roll",
    "1:08:12 - 1:08:18": "out your own model and what this shows here is the different pieces of the stack that you have to have so first you capture all of your data you got to",
    "1:08:18 - 1:08:24": "label it to be classified right for the model you've got to store it somewhere then you need to get one of these open",
    "1:08:24 - 1:08:30": "source AI models off the shelf and there's a probably the most prominent site for this called a hugging face",
    "1:08:30 - 1:08:37": "which already has something like I think a two billion dollar valuation that's another like really crazy valuation to",
    "1:08:37 - 1:08:44": "ARR multiple but hugging face has kind of all the open source models it's very active and so people grab the latest",
    "1:08:44 - 1:08:50": "open source model that's the best fit for them and then they need to train that model and that's really where",
    "1:08:50 - 1:08:56": "Mosaic played and there's a ton of activity right now in this last mile problem of how do you customize a model",
    "1:08:56 - 1:09:03": "to make it suitable for your use whether you're an Enterprise whether you're a customer service team whether you're a",

    "1:09:15 - 1:09:21": "and there's sort of a separate category around Hardware that is you know we don't play there but this is kind of the",
    "1:09:21 - 1:09:28": "end-to-end tool chain and I think these big tech companies are going to be racing to put this whole thing together to fill it out yeah yeah and that's so",

    "1:28:05 - 1:28:12": "and we can observe them and the rate at which the pulsing is coming out of these pulsars tells us a lot about what is",
