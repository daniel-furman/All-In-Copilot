0:13
we actually are going to show some q a from Jason's launch Summit which he held in Napa Valley this week great event
0:19
thanks for having us up there Jay Cal thanks for coming great speakers great content and we did a live q a
0:27
for the all in pod with the audience there which will transition to about
0:33
halfway through through the show today Jay Cal thanks for your hospitality oh yeah thank you the fun birthday party
0:39
the poker night we had a great time I still didn't know what I was doing there you were meeting some of your LPS who
0:45
you've never met before it was like a dog and pony show Jake Howell was using us as some sort of dog and pony show to
0:51
raise money Zack did you really have LPS there that you had never met no yes hold
0:57
on a second I had one LP there who I have definitely met many times before okay she told us she'd never met you she
1:02
wanted an introduction so maybe she's getting into the spirit of all in and joking with you but you had a three-hour meeting with one of your own pieces I
1:08
heard Chicago yeah she said she had like two or three hours are you with us today what's going on you're there buddy was
1:14
very drunk by the way he brought up his own wine he started Margarita well he was drunk by the time we got there what
1:19
he showed up he was day drinking margaritas in the sun oh and then we showed up and he was
1:25
like falling asleep by the time we were done with the steaks I said
1:32
[Music] David's side
1:40
we open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy [Music]
1:47
you know by the way politics is one of these incredible things where you see the meanest people
Why RFK Jr. is resonating
1:54
come out of the woodwork when you even feign support for somebody that they
2:00
don't support now that it's out there that sax and I are doing this fundraiser for RFK oh yeah if you look at Twitter
2:07
some of like the the Democratic surrogates are out just
2:14
smacking me and sax around and it's incredible these people are like the biggest
2:21
imposter loser clowns they've never literally done anything in
2:26
their whole life and then they show up and then they just like how dare you work and help build a company how dare
2:32
you help build another company how dare you help now fund other companies I am a
2:38
talking mouthpiece who's never done anything except work and want Administration as a speechwriter and now I think you guys suck balls it's like
2:44
give me a break so you are you a little kind of emotional about that today I actually I
2:51
love critiques actually because I think like you can learn a lot from critiques but then when mids just
2:57
spew I just get annoyed I think mids should not be allowed to talk yeah well that's
3:04
just my thought there goes half the internet sex are your Republican cohort
3:09
friends upset about you hosting a fundraiser for RFK I've got none of that none of that
3:15
that's interesting what's your take on that yeah do Republicans generally think that it's a good thing if RK Jr gets the
3:21
Democratic nomination because he will be easily beatable I don't think they're thinking that way I think that there's a
3:28
respect for RFK Jr among many Republicans because he's speaking out on
3:33
issues that they care about like I've talked about he's denouncing censorship he's in favor of free speech he's in
3:39
favor of civil liberties and you know not the this master surveillance State he's speaking out in favor of Peace
3:45
instead of War he's speaking out on the border he had this amazing video that was great a couple of days ago where he
3:51
went to the Border in Yuma Arizona at 2 A.M in the morning and he shows he shows
3:58
where the border wall ends and where the border wall ends the line begins and
4:03
people from all over the world are just entering through this hole in the wall in a never-ending stream of people and
4:10
then they get loaded onto buses provided by the government and then they get handed a ticket to supposedly appear in
4:18
court to resolve their case in three or four years and they're never heard from again and they're dispersed all over the
4:23
country what I don't understand is if the federal government can get its act together enough enough to provide buses
4:30
why can't they get their act together enough to plug the hole in the wall it's absurd this is like an act of sabotage
4:37
against the United States and so he's there just pointing this out I've never seen anything like this before it was
4:42
interesting as a as a Democrat to do this because that's typically kind of a Republican
4:48
point right and some of the commentary made about RFK Jr I think it was in the New York Times this week um or someone
4:54
that covered his candidacy one of the big media companies
5:00
highlighted how much of his agenda seems to be a republican talking point agenda
5:06
does that sound accurate even most uh people in the country who
5:11
identify as Democrats would be against having an open border that's what we're talking about when there's a hole in the
5:16
wall and people can just start forming a line and then once they get through the line right they're literally hold on
5:22
they're basically distributed throughout the country on buses I don't think most people in the country even Democrats would support that but what he's
5:30
violating here is the Press blackout on what's really going on at the border
5:35
he went there yeah but other Republican talking points so the points around the
5:42
vaccine the points are Republican well he's expressed obviously concerns about vaccines preceding the covet vaccine I
5:49
don't know whether he's right about that or not we're not willing to say whether he's right or wrong about that because I just don't know enough I think he's
5:55
definitely right about the inefficacy of the coveted vaccine we've talked about this before even Bill Gates admits now
6:01
that the vaccine doesn't work it's too short acting and it doesn't hold up against variance it's not a vaccine
6:07
let's just start let's see it doesn't prevent you from getting the illness it's a death reduction shot it was a revenue grab by big Pharma plastered
6:15
with non-scientific thinking from a bunch of people who should have known
6:20
better wow okay I think you just got our oh so much
6:26
this is just the truth hold on what shamas said is just like the factual reality and
6:31
and you can't get that from the mainstream media like there's no re-evaluation there's no appraisal they
6:37
control what we see in here it's like proveda level in terms of the propaganda and that's why I think RFK Jr is so
6:44
interesting is because he is blowing up what the mainstream media wants is
6:50
control the really interesting thing about him going to the Border I agree with sax is hey let's just have a discussion about this and look at the
6:56
actual facts on the ground that we can agree on and what he actually did was he pierced the vow of like this is an issue
7:02
about a certain group of people he was there and there are people from Afghanistan China all over the world coming in he made the point that this
7:09
isn't just about one country and that these people are suffering and that I thought was like another really important highlight these people are
7:15
being trafficked they're you know being abused at the border and that it's going to cost us 10 million
7:23
talking about it and he's done this with Ukraine as well where he emphasizes the
7:28
humanitarian aspect of it yes about it and I think Republicans should
7:33
adopt some of that he rhetoric and to jamaat's point I think it's it is I think it's a
7:39
MoneyGram I do think it lowered death rates but you know I do think piercing the veil on this and none of us are
7:45
still getting boosted because we know they don't work guys okay let's keep moving I'm not debating vaccines and politics we're moving on we're going to
7:51
talk about crypto so this week the SEC here we go serious action against binance and coinbase
US crypto crackdown: action against Binance & Coinbase
7:59
you know pretty significant pretty loud SEC filed 13 charges against Finance entities and the founders CC charges
8:06
include operating unregistered Securities exchanges broker dealers and clearing agencies misrepresenting their
8:13
trading controls and their oversight on the binance U.S platform and the unregistered offer and sale of
8:19
Securities the next day they sought a temporary restraining order to freeze binance's U.S assets
8:25
and then on Tuesday the SEC sued coinbase over their exchange and their
8:31
staking programs stock dropped 12 percent the SEC said that
8:37
the company was operating an unregistered exchange and broker and that 13 of their assets listed on their platform were considered crypto asset
8:44
Securities Brian Armstrong obviously has been on the Pod several times said he's
8:51
not shutting down his staking service and said regarding the SEC complaint against us today we're proud to
8:56
represent the industry in court to finally get some clarity around crypto rules he's generally made the statement that he has tried multiple times to
9:03
register with the SEC they have not had a mechanism for him to register they have tried to do everything by the
9:09
book and that the SEC approved their IPO filing knowing full well the details of their business and
9:15
their operating model and still allowed them to go public on a U.S Securities Exchange despite full knowledge about
9:22
their business Jamal does anything change this week based on the sec's action or is this just a continuation of
9:29
you know crypto has been rolled back and will continue to roll
9:34
back here in the U.S or is this something new and a new action and opens up a new front on the
9:41
uh the government versus crypto it's a good question I think there's two ways to look at this one
9:47
is the conspiracy theorist way which you see a lot of on
9:53
Twitter which is this idea that crypto is making all of these inroads
10:00
as a replacement mechanism for fiat currency and so governments are really
10:07
now invested in trying to shut it down I think that's largely untrue and then there's the more
10:14
simple basic reality which is that there was one part of the SEC
10:19
that frankly didn't do the job that they were supposed to by either allowing a few of these crypto companies or crypto
10:26
businesses to go public either as Standalone businesses or as part of other businesses so coinbase Robin Hood
10:33
Etc and then there's this part of the enforcement action after this FTX Fiasco
10:39
which is a lot of cya covering your ass by the SEC especially because it looked like they
10:46
had some cozy relationships with them and so they're coming down hard and they're going to go and systematically
10:51
dismantle the largest actors and they're going to go through the value chain so I think
10:57
the obvious place that they're looking now are the exchanges they'll look at the
11:03
custodial Services they will not approve any ETFs and then eventually I do think it
11:10
trickles into all of the staking services and eventually I think it'll touch the Venture community and all of those firms
11:17
and funds that had a huge robust business in staking
11:24
these crypto projects in order to get coins like founding coins and then being
11:29
able to sell them Jacob I mean I've been talking about this since the beginning because I I've bought Bitcoin and wrote
11:36
about Bitcoin when it was maybe 25 cents and then again when it was a hundred so I've been following this for a long time
11:42
and I think thinking from first principles just stepping back for a moment you know what we do in technology is fundamentally
11:48
disruptive if it's at its best if it's truly going to be important in the world and when you hear that word disruption
11:54
you kind of file it as a buzzword but what it really means at its core is like
11:59
competition and it's not just competition disruption when you say disruption you're talking about existential competition two people go in
12:06
the ring one person comes out like somebody's gonna get really up and if you people keep bringing up oh
12:12
you're an investor at Uber they broke the rules they bent the rules Uber was going against caps Airbnb was
12:18
going against like hotels wework was going against like long-term real estate leases when you look at all those
12:25
disruptive Technologies and what they did at their core they disrupted on
12:30
behalf of consumers and lower prices increased Choice et cetera when you get crypto
12:36
the crypto crowd literally said we are going to replace fiat currency fiat
12:41
currency is the government and so my thesis from the beginning was if the government has a way to stop this they
12:47
do not want to be disrupted what what is a government at its core it's a military it's a bunch of rules laws and it's
12:57
money that's the kind of pillars of any government's power we knew the
13:02
government wasn't going to give this up and you know they they effed around and found out but the truth is the and this
13:10
is where I have some sympathy for the crypto people not the people who are just committing crime with the whole way and just dumping these bags on retail
13:16
Etc but we do want to have this Innovation here there are some Innovative aspects to it but Gary Ganser
13:22
said listen you already have electronic money it's called money in the United States we already have these Services you don't need this consumers don't need
13:27
it and you have to understand the sec's function in the world to understand why they're taking this action their
13:33
function is to protect investors investors lost a bunch of money therefore they are going to
13:38
retroactively inflict pain and hold people accountable for their mandate
13:44
which is to protect investors you could have easily resolved this the SEC
13:49
and the company's gonna resolve this the companies could have followed these things as Securities and only allowed
13:54
accredited investors top five percent of the country people who make over 200k a year they didn't do that they said
14:00
anybody can buy these well that's just not how it works in America and it should change I think
14:06
everybody should be able to buy any security they want in America just like anybody can go play Blackjack and the
14:11
easiest solution for this just passed in Congress this week and we'll go to the Senate and be a lawsuit I think allowing
14:17
every American the other 94 to take a test and become accredited if that happens you take a test just like you
14:22
take a driver's license test I know what diversification is I know how risky these are once you take that 50 question
14:28
test you become accredited and then you can buy these coins if you want to and that's really the easiest path to
14:34
resolution here so we don't have Brian Armstrong move his company to the Middle East or uh you know an island in the
14:39
Caribbean which is what he's going to do I predict so okay well look we've seen this bill make its way I think through
14:47
is it going to the Senate next or is it going to the Senate yeah going to the Senate so let's see if it gets done I
14:53
think it's a it's a good point one thing I'll point out when individual investors were making
15:00
money because all of these asset values were inflating all of the coins were growing
15:05
and were climbing in value everyone felt good there was an emergent cry that we all
15:11
want to have access to these new instruments we all have a right to make these Investments and to own these
15:17
assets and then as the asset values declined and individual investors began
15:23
losing money the emergent cry is where was the government to help save and
15:28
protect us and so the SEC I would argue was probably a little bit hindered when
15:34
the market was inflating and being able to step in and take action because that would have been counter to the cries of the retail
15:41
Market but as the retail Market took their their hits the SEC has to step in
15:46
and Congress steps in and everyone starts to say it's time to act we should have acted sooner and this was you know
15:52
fairly predictable I think what's happening is more nefarious than that so the SEC is doing two different things
15:59
they're alleging two different kinds of crimes one set has to do with protecting
16:07
investors from having their funds stolen on these exchanges or at least
16:13
commingled FTX did that right where they basically took customer deposits and stole them what binance is accused of is
16:20
taking customer deposits maybe not stealing them but commingling them with company funds that should be looked at
16:25
and and I think crypto customers should be protected against that however the case against coinbase they're alleging a
16:32
completely different set of facts which is effectively what guns are in the SEC are saying is that it is not legal to
16:38
operate a crypto Exchange in the United States that is what the SEC is staying because coinbase has basically done
16:44
everything right and I believe that genzer is far exceeding his authority and stating something like that it is
16:50
not up to the chairman of the SEC to say that Americans should not be holding
16:55
crypto why as a free people should we not be able to buy crypto if we want to
17:01
you know why shouldn't we be able to buy Bitcoin now maybe you apply rules around accredited investor status there should
17:08
be protections against unsophisticated investors buying stuff or get defrauded that's fine that's the framework that
17:14
Brian Armstrong is asking for but everyone should understand what the SEC is doing right now is
17:21
basically usurping Congressional Authority it should be Congress that makes the law if Congress wants to ban
17:27
crypto exchanges in the United States and prevent the citizens of the United States from owning crypto let Congress
17:33
do it it should not be up to Gensler to do that and the question is why is guns
17:38
are going this far when previously he had relationships in the industry apparently he was a consultant to
17:44
binance and even worse he was talking to FTX about giving them some special status and I think the reason is the the
17:51
scuttlebutt is that he has an alliance with Elizabeth Warren and the rumor is
17:56
that you know she will make him treasury secretary if he basically destroys crypto in the U.S sorry where's the evidence for that that's just someone's
18:03
rumor and speculation this is the scuttlebutt in the industry okay so it's it's someone
18:08
this is in fact the back channel so just to be clear rumor and innuendo is what you're saying no look what I would say
18:14
is clear is that Gensler and Elizabeth Warren have an alliance to destroy crypto in the U.S this was speculated
18:20
about before with operation choke point but now it's clear they're trying to shut down choke point we've talked about
18:26
on the show before it was a series of actions taken what you do when you're in a hotel at night
18:32
no operation choke point was a series of actions by the US government to basically destroy all the on-ramps to
18:38
crypto so you couldn't get money into the system now they're going further and they're basically saying it is illegal
18:43
to operate a crypto Exchange in the United States yes
18:49
explain why I can explain why you're wrong what they're saying is it's not just the exchange it's that the exchange contains
18:56
uh unregistered security so it's a more nuanced point I think I think I agree
19:01
what security could you trade well if it passes the Howie test or it is registered and there are people who
19:07
have actually their registered their crypto passes the Howie test no they're going back on that you could pass it if
19:13
you limited it to accredited investors and the fact is Brian Armstrong binance and a lot of
19:20
crypto projects refused to exclude non-accredited investors and I watched
19:26
this happen up close and personally you're right about the unregistered Securities thing they're trying to say
19:32
that all crypto is on registered Securities no they literally they named them sacks
19:38
in the in the lawsuit they named the 16 or 13 what was it Friedberg so they they know how to it was 13 they know how to
19:45
craft this they're saying for these specific 13. now the industry does feel you're correct and the back channel is
19:50
everybody's against us but if they had just registered these they would not have a problem I don't think they're gonna I think it's not important is not
19:59
included he doesn't have a way of registering them they do they don't want to so they claim
20:05
they don't have a way of registering they could register it just like we all know we have privacy there's been a lot of people tweeting about this that the
20:11
SEC has put out statements saying our door is open come talk to us there is no Open Door there is no one to talk to
20:17
they have no idea how to get registered how do you think this is going to get resolved Armstrong's talked publicly
20:23
about going to Congress to try and get some clarifying law passed are you familiar with any of the
20:30
any of the drafting that might be going on to support his cause here or do you think it's going to get settled in the
20:35
courts first of all I think I think Brian Armstrong is is a really really really good entrepreneur
20:42
and I'm a really big fan of his that said
20:47
I just don't think that there's a lot of political support to visit this issue right now
20:55
and so unfortunately I'm pretty skeptical that you're going to see any
21:01
form of legislation pass I unfortunately think that
21:09
the SEC has by and large put the entire sector into mate and so I think that
21:15
what Jason said is largely right which is that it's
21:20
going to force these companies to preserve Enterprise Value to to leave the United States and to
21:27
jurisdictionally operate from a different place and to basically IP block and IP gate U.S residents from
21:35
using their products and services I also think that they're going to have to pay large fines and so the only thing
21:42
that will be left is to adjudicate all of the staking stuff that that happened and whether that was right or
21:48
wrong right so the court it'll get settled it'll get decided I agree with that and I think I think that when you
21:53
start talking about minutia like well these 16 cryptos are okay or not okay no
21:59
look you're kind of missing the point the government led by Gensler is in a Full Assault on crypto and the goal is
22:06
basically to either destroy in the US or drive it offshore tremath is right about that and the question is why and I think
22:12
jaycal you made the point that progressives like Elizabeth Warren see crypto as competition to fiat currency
22:21
and they do not want there to be a competitor now what is the reason for that I think it's because of their radical spending schemes remember in the
22:27
first years of The Binding Administration the progressives wanted a four and a half trillion dollar build back better Bill remember
22:35
Larry Summers told them that you're going to cause inflation and even the
22:40
750 billion dollar scope down version that they ultimately passed caused a lot of inflation and it causes the problems
22:45
that we have now that we're seeing in the economy but they wanted four and a half trillion and when people were opposed to it and said we couldn't fund
22:51
this they were in favor of minting trillion dollar coins yeah so these are
22:56
the people who don't want any check on their ability to spend down the full faith and credit of the United States
23:02
they would basically spend all the money that we have they would basically eat the seed corn or don't have that we
23:09
don't have that I think you guys agree we should not be spending and that is why they're the faction in our political
23:14
system who are most against crypto hold on I gotta respond to it two things
23:20
can be true one the government doesn't want to give up control of Fiat I agree with that
23:25
second thing that's also true is that this group of people did not want to play by the rules they knew the rules
23:30
they explicitly broke them for profit that's why they have them dead to rights you can name this operation choke point
23:37
you can brand it you can put out any conspiracy theory you want they did have the option
23:42
Theory you agree they're trying to run these guys out of business I said two things can be true at the same time David these this is a tolerance for
23:48
ambiguity being able to hold two things at the same time and they don't want to give up control
23:54
yeah that's what's happening that's the rule you have to file as a security you have to only allow them you said that
23:59
coinbase was a good actor I believe they have good intentions yes I don't believe the other people do I do
24:05
believe you believe that coinbase is in violation of the law I believe the Securities they trading are in violation
24:11
of Law and that's obvious if you but I believe that law should change let me give you security points our security
24:17
jaycal let me give you a third point and sex Elizabeth Warren she may be motivated by
24:24
the intention to preserve the authority of the Fiat but is it not also possible that a large
24:31
number of people lost a lot of money that they worked hard for and they used to buy crypto assets and then the value
24:38
of those assets went down and those people lost a lot of value I had there was a group of guys that are house
24:45
painters that painted my house two summers ago and they painted the whole house they were here every day for
24:51
hours every day so I got to speak to these guys and these these guys were House Painters
24:56
you know they they work for an hourly wage they do fairly well but every lunch break every break they got all that they
25:03
would talk about with one another was what cryptocurrency they're buying and trading in and out of with the whole
25:09
intention of making money they all believed that they had a good point of view because they read something on the
25:15
Internet or got some tweet or got some text or saw something on Tick Tock about this one crypto asset or this crypto
25:21
asset and they were trading in and out and all of the money that these guys worked hard for was being invested in
25:27
crypto assets you're right that set of facts is not great however I don't think that's a motivation I think the motivation is to basically end crypto as
25:35
a potential competitor to Fiat money in the United States that's the motivation and they're going to use those fact
25:41
patterns to basically support that because look fair enough because we could handle that okay we could do the
25:47
accredited investor test there should be a framework or a set of guidelines under which it is legal for people to buy and
25:55
hold or trade crypto in the United States all that Brian has been asking for is give us a framework and genzer is
26:01
not giving a framework he's just trying to basically put them out of business okay look I think we've gone around this topic this has been a great conversation
Sequoia splits into three
26:08
I'm going to move forward to the next topic which I think is
26:13
really interesting in the vein of both de-globalization but also you know the
26:19
scale at which Venture firms have gotten to Sequoia decided this week and announced publicly that they're
26:25
splitting off their China and India slash southeast Asia funds as you guys obviously know Sequoia
26:32
capital is a venture capital firm and within that firm they manage multiple
26:38
funds some of the funds that they've raised and managed have been specifically targeted in China where
26:44
they have 56 billion dollars I don't know if this number is accurate but that's an incredible number 56 billion
26:50
dollars of assets under management Focus just in Sequoia China and then they have a sequoia India fund
26:57
which has about four billion dollars of capital raised in just the last three years and now they are separating the
27:04
management company and the oversight of those funds into separate management companies so Sequoia Capital will no
27:11
longer oversee those China funds a new firm has been formed called Sequoia China that is now owned and run by a
27:18
separate management team based in China and Sequoia India is now called Peak 15 Partners which is owned and operated by
27:24
a separate team of managers out of India roll off Botha will manage the U.S and
27:30
European Sequoia capital Neil Chen will oversee Sequoia China
27:36
I'm sorry Neil Shen and shailendra is saying we'll oversee Sequoia India I
27:42
guess this is a question of did Sequoia get too big or are they caving to pressure of the political issues arising
27:49
with having deep relationships and ties with China or as they have said a lot of competition between these different
27:55
portfolios and companies Within These portfolios amongst each other chamoth what's your read on the action is there
28:01
anything to read into this and anything to extrapolate from it well it's been a parade of missteps for Sequoia in the
28:07
last couple of years and I'll let Sequoia figure out who to blame for this but the reality is
28:14
they I think felt a lot of fomo posts off bank they raised this large Mega
28:21
fund that kind of straddled all of the sub funds and straddled all of the regions and so
28:27
they dangled the carrot of trying to get into the early stage U.S fund by investing in this big Mega fund that
28:32
also had China and Indie exposure and growth exposure then they tried this like very
28:39
convoluted Evergreen structure right before the market fell apart where you could basically become a
28:47
permanent Capital vehicle and as far as I can tell from the outside looking in it just seems like a taxi tax
28:55
play for the GPS to not have to sell and realize capital gains
29:01
but that only works when the stock market keeps going up which it didn't and then it's summarily
29:06
Crush tech stocks 80 or 90 so that was a misstep and then when you put all these things together
29:12
now that China is Contracting and we've said this before I think China is largely uninvestable for the next 30 or
29:18
40 years it just makes sense to jettison now I will say though that Neil Shen is
29:25
Elite if you consider in investing I would say I have a simple rubric anybody who's made more than a billion dollars
29:32
for themselves as an investor I consider Elite Neil Shen is Elite
29:37
and so he'll do just fine running that Sequoia China business I
29:44
was surprised about why they would allow India to leave there's nobody that Elite
29:49
at Sequoia India by that rubric but India is a country growing at six
29:54
percent a year it literally looks like China in 2008 and 9. and so I'm not sure
30:01
why you would let them leave I think that you would want to attach them to yourself because it makes the US
30:07
business look better you probably gets differentiated and smoothed out returns
30:13
but I think this is a little bit of particular of competition that there was competition between the the different
30:19
portfolio companies and it was leading to conflict I mean that's dumb that happens in the
30:26
United States Sequoia has always been known to fund everybody that they think will make money no matter how much they
30:32
compete when they back YouTube and Moritz was sitting on the board at Google and sure
30:38
look Sequoia Sequoia as an organization is Elite they're there to make money for their LPS period end of story and so all
30:45
of the other words that can go in any press release basically I think try to hide the fact that this is an
30:50
organization that's hats and missteps they're not on Solid Ground they've lost a lot of money and they're trying to
30:57
figure out what to do next I however if I was running that organization would have probably done
31:03
nothing and just let the dust settle and I think that all of these actions
31:10
are too close together and it's a little bit to me of flailing in the water and
31:15
so I don't think it was a good idea to let India leave I think it made a ton
31:21
of sense to cut China but I think all of this stuff happened started happening a few years ago
31:27
starting with that eight or nine billion dollar Mega fund that they raised to try to compete with suffix
31:33
Saxony read on this yeah I mean I think it's a example probably an example of decoupling and
31:39
globalization going on so I agree we have to treat India and China separately with respect to China I just think it's
31:46
become harder and harder for Americans to do business in China both because we
31:53
don't really have the visibility into that system and there's too much
31:58
political uncertainty so kind of touch Ma's point about it being increasingly uninvestable but I also think that
32:04
geopolitical concerns it's just very hard to straddle those concerns now because the geopolitical competition is
32:10
heating up so much I think it's investable for people like Neil Shen who are insiders in that system so I think
32:18
you know Elite Chinese investors can I'm sure make money in China over the next few decades but I think it's just too
32:24
hard for Americans to figure that out so I think them parting ways makes a lot of
32:30
sense I think it's going to simplify sequoia's life a lot India I I agree with jamas that that's
32:36
sort of a different question because India is going to be a huge growth economy over the next few decades and they are a U.S Ally so it doesn't pose
32:44
the same geopolitical risk but my guess is that it was just kind of unwieldy that it's too unwieldy to kind
32:54
of merge funding sources and firm management across two firms that are
32:59
really pretty different right the U.S aquarium firm and then this Indian firm so my guess is they just decoupled
33:05
because it was just getting too hard to manage and if you're an LP don't you just want the ability to say okay I'm
33:10
going to allocate this much money to India and I'm going to allocate this much money to the US I think LPS
33:16
probably like it too Sequoia China is frankly over the last 15 or 20 years as good and probably is
33:24
numerically better than Sequoia us so that was an elite organization just
33:30
by itself Sequoia India I don't think has much to talk about and so maybe what
33:35
Roloff decided is this team is just not very good so we might as well just cut it and we can revisit it later they
33:40
probably have some number of years of a non-compete and then they could come back into the market five years with a totally new team and that may be easier
33:47
so it may be easier just to just actually wanted to be separate look it's hard to cross returns from two totally
33:55
different funds right because one side one side's gonna be unhappy with the trade right yeah I I
34:01
can give you the jaycal's got actual information to share well no I mean I have to know I think I have the closest
34:07
one invest in your company right Jacob well I'm an LP in their funds they're printing money for me they back my
34:13
second startup roll-offs on the board of that company and still with me and I was their first Scout when they started the scouts program
34:19
which is the highest percentage performing fund I think they ever had you're our resident Captain America so
34:27
as a patriot how do you feel about it they are put that aside um sequoise 20 of the NASDAQ this is the greatest
34:32
Venture firm of all time hands down and the Sequoia fund which refers you mean companies they've
34:38
invested in companies I guess and so the reason the Sequoia fund came out this Evergreen fund was
34:46
because a lot of their LPS wanted Sequoia to manage the public equities
34:51
going forward because they didn't want to sell them because they realized that the massive gains the the
34:58
gains from Google Apple Etc of these Investments that they did when they were
35:05
private companies Cisco the gains from public forward were greater than the gains in private and I've been in on
35:11
these presentations I've sat through them uh with the Sequoia team and so when you manage those public ones we've
35:19
all talked about the denominator problem here the denominator problem is hey are they Venture returns or are they part of
35:24
the public Equity so at a giant endowment they want to put them into the equities bucket get them out of the Venture bucket and Sequoia store an
35:30
opportunity there to manage this Evergreen fund I'm sure there are tax advantages to it of course but with
35:36
relation to what they did in China and India these these were incredibly
35:42
prescient and Innovative things they did in 2000 and
35:47
2005 when they started India and then China was 2005 I believe they found domestic teams you need domestic teams
35:54
to do this properly especially in places with different governance and different regulations and it gives them autonomy
36:01
they were incredible Investments but what's happening right now is all
36:06
venture Investments because of AI and chips and the decoupling with China are now under massive scrutiny so they can
36:13
say there's brand confusion you can talk about you know the collisions and who's going to back this Chinese entrepreneur
36:20
and Indian entrepreneur who also is operating in the US right these businesses operate in the U.S and so
36:26
what really is happening is the government is going to stop all U.S Venture investing in China that's
36:32
what's going to happen in the coming months and so they're just getting ahead of that and now they will compete
36:38
it really has to do with chips and AI you may have seen some of these stories and nobody's going to invest your if an
36:44
American invests in AI in China that's going to be bad and the same with chips yeah you're right there are a bunch of
36:50
stories about whether U.S investors should be investing in AI in China and people are saying this was Un-American
36:57
because it was basically going to give China an advantage against us in this key industry and I think that point is a
37:04
good example of what I'm talking about with the geopolitical concerns it's just getting too complicated yes for Americans to invest in China it raises
37:10
too many geopolitical concerns and I think Sequoia is massively simplifying its life by just splitting these things
37:17
up and being out did you see Keith Roberts tweets on this yeah that's what we're referring to yeah Keith from boy
37:22
tweeted basically like it's Un-American to invest in China at this point yeah we've talked about this before I mean
37:27
look the Chinese relationship primarily used to be seen as an economic relationship and people are looking for
37:33
a win-win basically trade scenarios and it was not seen as a moral to invest western China now the relationship is
37:40
primarily seen through a geopolitical lens which is to say the balance of power which is a zero-sum game it's
37:46
about you know how much better is the US doing how much more powerful is it than China and anybody who's perceived as
37:52
helping China in that rubric now is looked on skeptically within what do you think the United States about that
37:59
well like I said I don't think that's going to change so I think Sukhoi is doing the right thing to cut like I said simplify its life what's your personal
38:05
opinion I'm curious I think that it should be possible to do business
38:10
with China without it being seen as either unpatriotic or immoral however there are strategic technologies that
38:19
are just going to be I think it's too hard and too risky to um to be supporting China in chips and
38:26
AI yeah I mean look if somebody is using Chinese manufacturing to make toys or
38:31
clothes I don't think that's fun at least strategic in a geopolitical way but
38:37
if you're helping them make the next generation of chips that's going to raise a lot of questions
38:44
so so a VC firm Freebird can't take out chips and AI from their investment hold
38:49
on hold on I want to say something because sure this reminds me of when Benchmark actually had Benchmark Europe and then they cut it do you guys
38:56
remember that right yeah I do yeah and kind of retrenched they weren't retrenching from a position of strength they were retrenching to re-establish
39:03
themselves after a bunch of missteps so I think typically these retrenchments happen when there's a little bit of
39:08
internal chaos and mismanagement and underperformance that's not the case here I can assure you yeah but I
39:14
actually think retrenching is good because it simplifies things yeah I I totally agree with you my point
39:21
is when I saw that overlay fund I was like this is questionable but then when
39:26
I saw that weird Evergreen fund that to me just seemed like a tax ARB and I
39:32
thought to myself as a person who's looked at this exact stuff for my own stuff what I did was I just converted it to a
39:39
family office and from a tax perspective it was much simpler but that exact same
39:44
structure I looked at for myself and the reason that that structure exists and Jason I know you want to think it's
39:51
because these endowments want them to manage public equities I still work with a few endowments and pension systems
39:56
they don't and the reason they don't is they're not allowed to they're not allowed for concentration purposes they
40:01
pay other people to manage it they have these outside consultants and for fiduciary perspective you have to do all
40:07
of these things with respect to managing risk and one of the most obvious things that these foundations do is they get
40:12
distributions and they sell they don't hold and so the reason why you'd want to look at the long-term gains of a stock
40:19
that you distributed is because the GP sold too early not the lp and I just
40:25
don't I think that you should not just be a blithe surrogate on this topic and actually really think about it well I
40:31
mean I don't think you need to well I'm not I'm not and you know square if you look at something like that you know
40:37
rule off still on the border Square I believe so they Sequoia has realized over time you know as it's been
40:42
explained to me as NLP that you know these companies grow the outliers continue to grow massively
40:49
when they become public and Sequoia is now staying on the board of those companies and so they actually have the most insight into it because they backed
40:55
it when it was two people and then they're still on the board money is not infinite and if you're a foundation and
41:01
you're legally obligated to distribute some percentage every year you need the money back and the foundations do get to
41:07
choose some foundations want to go along Harvard or whoever I'm just picking you know one of the large ones if somebody's
41:13
got 30 40 billion dollars they may not need to liquidate that and they might very much the only person that is in a position to
41:20
actually hold for the long term because it's so tax advantageous is the GP that is why that fund was created and I
41:26
will bet you if you ask him under oath why they did it I'll tell you it was for themselves
41:33
people have the choice I bet you a million dollars for charity whatever you want to do I bet you if you put them
41:39
under oath then you subpo them and you ask him why he did it he'll say he did it for himself and that's fine all I'm
41:44
saying is that's the kind of complexity that sax is talking about that does not add to success it is over complexifying
41:51
something that doesn't need to be complicated yeah I disagree with you but we can just move on well we agree to disagree
PGA merges with LIV, Lionel Messi's revolutionary deal with the MLS, Apple, and Adidas
41:56
sometimes here on the all-in podcast we're going to move on for our last topic of the day with the uh
42:02
announcements can we talk messy no no we're not we're because we're going to do one last topic which I think PGA and
42:07
Messi go together yeah so let's just talk about PGA guys I appreciate the messy interest but
42:14
we're going to talk about something less messy or even more messy who cares actually think it's pretty interesting for a couple of reasons so as you guys
42:21
know the PGA Tour has been around since 1930 I think the PGA Tour makes 1.6
42:27
billion dollars a year if reports are correct I make 1.6 billion a year boring that's I mean depends on the year
42:34
all of the players on the PGA tour are independent contractors so uh Saudi
42:40
Arabia's public investment fund and this is what I think is one of the more interesting aspects of this story
42:46
and maybe speaks to a broader kind of set of geopolitical
42:52
transitions that are underway the Saudi Arabian public invention uh public investment fund started live golf as an
42:59
alternative to the PGA Tour live golf live golf They invested uh two billion dollars of capital and offered
43:08
guarantees to Golfers to come and get on their tour they ended up offering at one
43:13
point Tiger Woods reportedly got a 800 million dollar guarantee to join their tour which he turned down
43:20
Phil Mickelson got a reported 200 million guarantee which he took to join the tour hidaki Matsuyama got offered
43:26
750k 750 million so seven of the 10 top paid golfers in
43:32
the world actually signed up and um it caused obviously significant disruption to what has effectively been
43:39
a monopoly which is the PGA tour in golf in professional golf and uh here we are two years later and
43:47
it was announced this week that live and PGA are merging and the current PGA Tour
43:52
conditioner Jay Moynihan will serve as CEO of the new entity just by way of reference J Moynihan
43:58
makes a reported 14 to 15 million dollars a year in salary as CEO of the PGA Tour he will now be CEO of this
44:05
combined organization one big question mark is how much is he getting paid and did that help secure and solidify this
44:12
deal getting done but I think another big question is do we think this will actually close will this face Regulatory and antitrust
44:19
scrutiny will this face cypheus because it is the Saudi Arabian public investment fund that is effectively
44:24
taking a large stake in the PGA tour let's go to our resident professional
44:30
sports team owner or former minority owner tomoth and he takes on on this announced merger
44:38
what does it say about the pga's ability to hold action this is what's so crazy about your topic selection
44:44
Messi was offered 1.6 billion dollars personally by the Saudis and you don't want to talk about that because you want
44:50
to talk about a whole organization playing an Antiquated sport that itself generates 1.6 billion dollars
45:01
what's your point I don't care about golf I don't care the reason this is so
45:07
controversial is that they're calling it Sports washing trying to make the reputation of
45:13
Saturday more palatable in the west by using Sports things people love the reason this has become controversial is
45:20
because of the hypocrisy of it the PGA fought against Liv and
45:26
this guy Jay Moynihan who is the CEO of this he basically evoked the 911
45:32
families and went on a whole thing about how evil live was only to then secure
45:38
the bag and then there's some background here about well there was a lawsuit
45:44
between the live golfers you know who are now banned from playing the PGA when they signed up and Anti-Trust stuff and
45:51
so the hypocrisy of the group is what's being pulled into the question here this
45:57
is why it's important the players who took the money were ostracized as
46:02
supporting an evil regime yeah and now it's clear that they were
46:07
smart and tigers should have taken the money and actually the guy who said as much at the time was was Trump you know he you
46:16
know yeah he nailed it it's like one of these uh once again once again no he said he's basically
46:23
said that take the money from Lyft because eventually live in PGA are going to merge and then the guys who stuck with BJ are gonna get nothing and
46:29
they're gonna feel like idiots he was totally right he's you don't think that that's insane I
46:36
mean come on it's pretty amazing tell me when you get to Messi and the fact that these guys were proclaiming that if
46:42
you're gonna go join this tour you're joining you know you're lining up I don't understand whether I don't understand whether you're naive or dumb
46:48
this is like about money it's always about money professional sports all the money's been about money what what are
46:54
we what are we talking about money money money money money there's your answer money drove the answer money
47:00
drove the deals now money drove the merger I don't understand can we talk about Messi please it's so much more
47:06
interesting okay go talk about message I mean the messy thing is so incredible
47:11
because Cristiano Ronaldo went to a team in Saudi to play in the August of his
47:17
career the last two or three years and this has been a thing that started with Pele in the 70s Pele came to the New
47:23
York Cosmos and played Beckham famously did it as well came to the LA Galaxy
47:28
but Beckham did this one interesting thing which is he said okay I'm gonna come to playing the MLS
47:34
on one condition really which is I'll take a huge pay cut and all this stuff but I want an option to buy an expansion
47:40
team for 25 million bucks fast forward he ended up buying intermiami
47:46
that team is now worth 585 million dollars so Messi is 36 years old he's about to
47:53
enter the August of his career he's won everything he's done everything possible he is so incredible I mean I love him
47:59
I love him he gets offered 400 million dollars a year for four years to go play in Saudi
48:06
Arabia a 1.6 billion dollar deal and you know there's no income tax here so
48:11
that's like 1.6 billion dollars right in his pocket except the deal that he did which was
48:18
for a lot less upfront is really interesting he basically said I'll come to the
48:25
United States and play in intermiami for for the Miami Football Club
48:30
but I am you know basically I'm not sure he said this so I'm using my own words
48:36
I'm the greatest player in the world every time I do something magical on the field I'm creating content that will
48:42
sell tickets and create brand awareness and move the interest level of soccer in
48:47
the United States I'm a content creator so I want a piece of this content
48:52
and so Apple who signed a two and a half billion dollar 10-year license for the MLS said
48:58
you're right you're probably going to sell more subscriptions for me I'll give you a piece of the ref share
49:03
and then Adidas said you know what you're right you're probably gonna sell more shoes for me I'll give you a piece
49:09
of those shoes so in one Fell Swoop I think what's amazing is Messi is not an athlete in
49:16
this deal I think going back to a theme that we've talked about a lot is he is this
49:22
ultimate penultimate whatever he's an elite content creator he's the equity who is now creating incredible who will
49:30
come to the United States to create this incredible content that will move viewership move merchandise
49:36
and he's going to monetize that so it's effectively like becoming the Jordan brand getting a piece of Netflix all in
49:43
one he has the equity in those businesses basically yeah there's a subtle Point shabbat's making in the deal you have the person who's
49:51
responsible for distribution so this would be the same as like the NBA on ABC ESPN or TNT and TNT or ESPN saying you
49:58
know what you're so important LeBron James to play in this or Steph Curry we're going to give you a piece of the
50:04
subscriptions to ESPN so apple is giving him rev share on their Apple TV league
50:10
pass for MLS that's nuts like and this is I think it goes back to the live uh
50:17
deal with PGA which is people are looking at these sports leagues and saying let's get creative it goes back
50:22
into a different one the the NBA just signed a new collective bargaining agreement that they're going to ratify I
50:28
always thought that the real thing that the NBA players association should be asking for Equity was Equity yeah and
50:36
that equity could be Phantom equity in the teams because it's clear that in the absence of the players there's no
50:42
viewership and there's no appreciation in the value of those franchises and so the idea that LeBron you know Steph Dre
50:50
KD don't own a huge piece of the underlying Equity gains that they're creating in
50:57
the period in which their players is pretty crazy now the ownership their perspective is while we translate that
51:03
in terms of rapture but it's really not true because if you look at the kager the irr of the franchise values
51:11
versus the catering of the salaries they're not equivalent yeah so I just think it has huge
51:16
implications to all the professional sports leagues because these big stars should be asking
51:23
their agents and their managers how do I do a deal like message I am the ultimate content creator in my league the
51:28
Dynamics are changing it will it will no longer be an employee Capital labor situation but capital is merging with
51:36
labor and labor labor is basically becoming the equity in the equation and
51:41
they are 100 of the business and by the way the reason we see it happening so much is because of the
51:47
social media age and it's really incredible I know you have more
51:53
I have more to say I just want to hire a highlight I need to go I have to go to a kindergarten graduation congratulations
51:59
congratulations I love you guys I'll see you later adios congrats to your kid thank God but what's really interesting
52:06
to your point about the CBA is they're going to make these huge salaries they're not going to give them the
52:12
equity as part of their five-year deal they make the money
52:17
they then have the ability to invest in a team so you could be LeBron and you could be investing in the Knicks maybe
52:23
if somebody wanted to sell a percentage of it you can invest in any NBA team any sports betting team any sports betting I
52:31
actually think there's a simpler way to do this which is it's it I think it's fair to say that when you join a team it's like joining a company yeah and you
52:37
can create Shadow equity and that shadow Equity says you came in at this point right you left at this point here was
52:45
the Delta of the value and I think a good Agent should be negotiating on behalf of a player most players will not
52:51
get that much a few basis points of that value yeah but the idea that a LeBron James can go to on Miami and double the
52:58
franchise value double yeah right from you know one
53:04
okay great stuff comes in at 480 million and is now 5.3 billion so that's a
53:09
10xing plus a value you know is Step responsible for 10 or 15 should a
53:15
billion dollars of that go to Steph Dre and Clay I think you can make a great claim that it could yeah absolutely put
53:21
them on the map so yeah it would be and it would be pretty easy to do and what this might do is keep
53:26
people on the same team longer which is what fans want exactly why people moving around that's a great point and private
53:32
companies like Cargill or Coke Industries they have these shadow Equity programs that they've had for years for
53:39
decades that they've run on behalf of their employees so we know how to run
53:45
Phantom Equity programs in private businesses and I just think the leadership of the
53:51
NBA Players Association the NFL players Association is right now still lacking the
53:56
sophistication to understand this well enough to then propose when the next time it is to to
54:03
negotiate this kind of deal but when you see things like this messy deal
54:08
I think it's a game changer it is a game changer and I think for sports I don't know if you saw Adam Silver gave
54:16
you know a little press conference with the finals and everything he was talking about the Jay Moran situation with the
54:21
guns and just a lot of like topics coming up but one of the topics that was probably underappreciated was he was
54:26
talking about the bundle the cable bundles going away and that people can't watch like the TNT uh NBA on TNT
54:34
whatever that is with you know Charles Barkley et cetera and he wants that to be available for free so he's going to
54:40
challenge people in the new TV deal if you want to have the NBA you have to have it available to everybody because
54:45
the number of people who can see NBA games has been going down I have a question for you more people do you
54:52
think more people would pay for a subscription to watch the Knicks games wherever they happen to be all over the
54:58
world or a subscription to watch Steph Curry no matter what team he plays on the old Generations are loyal to the
55:03
teams the new generations loyalty players so it's a generation numerical numerical question which one's great it's probably a jump ball right now but
55:10
it will eventually be they'll follow the players because this new generation follows players like our kids like I don't know
55:16
LeBron I think you could probably sell a few hundred thousand subscriptions to
55:21
the Knicks and I think you'd sell mid Millions for Stuff what's going to happen now is I think
55:27
they're going to they just want this to be ad based and to directly subscribe so I directly subscribe to the NBA I get
55:33
every game for 200 a year with no ads you know what we should do I actually have I have a great idea what we should do is we should what Liv did to the PGA
55:41
we should do to the NBA let's get together 20 billion dollars let's start a competitive NBA league where we give
55:48
the players oh I'm serious a structured Phantom Equity plan pay these guys 100 million bucks a year
55:55
get all the big guys to come everybody else will come and just blow the whole thing wide open by the way that's the blueprint now if
56:01
you want to really compete with the with the NFL or the NBA or the NHL this is what you should do put together 20 or 30
56:06
billion which is not that much money and go for it you only need to get a couple of stars to to blow it up and if
56:13
you give Stars the equity in the league they'll convince all the other players to come all right give let's give sack some red meat here you sax will give you
Ukraine update, Tucker on Twitter
56:18
a little red meat you want Tucker on Twitter here's your redmi choices as we wrap you want Tucker on Twitter
56:25
you want a Russian controlled dam being destroyed for a major flood or
56:32
do you want Chris Christie joining the race which red meat would you like which red meat we put in front of crazy hair
56:39
well I mean what's happening Ukraine is really the big news this week intensive has well the Ukrainian counter
56:45
offensive has started in earnest and yes in conjunction with that you had the destruction of that major Dam which
56:52
it's not clear who did it I mean both sides are pointing the finger at each other so and there are
56:58
reasonable Arguments for why either side may have done it in terms of who benefits it seems to benefit the
57:05
ukrainians more because the destruction of the dam washed out a bunch of Russian
57:10
defensive fortifications and Villages of Russian speakers on the
57:16
other hand the Russians were in control of the dam so it would have been easier for them to
57:22
carry it out if they had wanted to we just don't know but I think you know events have now moved beyond that and we
57:28
are now probably in the third or fourth day of of the Ukrainian counter offensive of course has not been officially declared but there is major
57:35
major fighting happening now where Ukrainian armored divisions are seeking
57:40
to you know penetrate Russian defensive lines around zaparizia and so the
57:47
long-awaited Ukrainian counter offensive has certainly begun how does the
57:52
the dam relate to the Nordstrom pipeline because these are both situations where people are like who actually did it
57:58
what's their motivation and let's face it these are chaotic actors at times and
58:05
figuring out who has the motivation to do these things seems like a leveling up kind of game
58:11
because you can't put it past either party in some cases but in the case of nortream
58:17
people saying hey it was the Ukraine but then there's this argument that the Ukraine is not capable of doing it or maybe it was sanctioned by the us or the
58:23
west and then executed by Ukraine where do you wind up with all these so on on nordstream we're now on our third cover
58:29
Story the CIA sourcing their stenographers at the Washington Post have now claimed that it was six
58:36
Ukrainian dudes in a yacht who blew up nordstream no seriously and if you look at this
58:42
boat I'll put a photo of the boat on the screen it's it's pretty silly yeah the opinions do not have a navy and they
58:49
certainly don't have Navy Seals I don't believe they have the capability to by the way this destruction in Nordstrom
58:55
Nordstrom was this huge underwater steel and concrete structure it's not that
59:02
deep though because it's only 150 or 200 feet deep at the lower points it's deep enough and it took a lot of explosives
59:09
so they had to know what they were doing so I I dove 120 feet once so it's but the point is that when when Nordstrom
59:15
was first destroyed the media rushed out to say well the Russians did it even though the Russians
59:21
had no motive to do it it was their pipeline is there a pipeline they could just turn it off if they wanted to but this is what we hear is that every
59:27
time something destructive happens it's the Russians did it why would they attack themselves because they're so crazy we heard this with the Nord stream
59:34
when belgarad which is a Russian District just across the border from Ukraine was attacked
59:40
it was claimed that the Russians did it these were Russian insurgents no that's pretty silly it was ukrainians dressed
59:46
in Russian uniforms and just recently when there were drone attacks on Moscow we were also told that oh it wasn't the
59:52
ukrainians who did it was Russian dissidents or something which again makes no sense so this is not to say
59:57
that the Russians didn't blow up that Dam it's just to say that whenever the story
1:00:03
is rushed out that the Russians did something highly destructive you have to we need to see some evidence here and we
1:00:09
just don't know it's just hard to know the fog of war is thick all right what do you think of Tucker's
1:00:15
first show incredible getting sued but he got The Tweak got at least like 90 million
1:00:22
views which means the video probably got 10 of that or something yesterday was at 17 million views or
1:00:28
something like that so I'm sure it's more today so no he's getting a huge distribution through Twitter arguably
1:00:34
it's more distribution it's almost certainly more distribution than he got through Fox Fox was 3 million right yes
1:00:39
that's how many viewers he gets on Fox yeah well Fox is half of that now because they've David traded so much viewership after
1:00:46
Tucker left but look the only thing that I think Tucker got through Fox was access to frankly a viewership base
1:00:53
that's not very online there are a lot of old people who watch Fox who just aren't on social media that's it though
1:00:59
everybody else can see it on Twitter and he's getting more Distribution on Twitter
1:01:04
super distribution is the way to go he's gonna get 25 million people and of course
1:01:10
monetizing it is the hard part because Fox is subscription revenue and everything else is there but apparently
1:01:16
he's creating a list um you know he advertised the website Tucker carlson.com at the end of his
1:01:22
video and you can go there and sign up for you can subscribe direct and get it on his website well I don't think he's
1:01:28
monetizing it yet but you can sign up for alerts and so forth so he's clearly creating a list of some kind oh that's
1:01:34
probably because he yeah with his contract he's still getting paid and so he's like yeah daily wire is the model I
1:01:40
mean they they've got well over 100 million in Revenue I understand and they have a massive subscription business so
1:01:47
there's a clear path all right Hey listen for the uh world's greatest moderator
1:01:52
living in the Bay Area David Friedberg and uh the dictator himself apatia and
1:01:58

1:04:17
except for the five-year-old fun that's already fully returned okay whoa easy so uh welcome to the angel
1:04:24
Summit uh these are my besties we do a podcast called all in we thought we'd do it live this is the fourth time we've
1:04:31
ever appeared on stage together the first two times we're at freeburg's LP
1:04:37
conference in the Presidio yeah I resented that one too
1:04:44
[Music] yes I came out in his mask he took his gloves off it was very uncomfortable for
1:04:50
him but he eased into a seat and then of course we did the all in Summit uh last year in Miami and this is the fourth
1:04:57
time so it's great to be out here we have a couple of news items on the docket we could start with or we can go right to q a with these many audience
1:05:05
members who have a lot of questions what would your gentlemen like to do so math has a few words he'd like to say
1:05:11
go ahead whatever you guys want to do chamoth is drunk by the way he texted us
1:05:16
you got grin on his face that's the chamoth grin he gives when he decided like x
1:05:23
capital scheming that he would not have LPS and he would just invest his own money he does not care
1:05:30
so it's the gloves are off let's do q a j Levy's sax what's the path for
1:05:35
DeSantis to win the nomination um and get the base of trump oh red meat oh goodness
1:05:41
here we go I think the path basically is he has to win Iowa and or New Hampshire
1:05:46
it's just that simple but keep in mind that Trump did not win Iowa last or in 2016 Ted Cruz did Iowa
1:05:55
tends to be more religious um I think DeSantis is trying to outflank Trump on the right actually on
1:06:03
certain issues and um so he's on the ground there campaigning from what I understand he's
1:06:09
generating a lot of interest and enthusiasm and he's going to keep plugging away at it I think he's going to out hustle
1:06:14
Trump I'm not saying he's going to win but I think he's going to work harder and the path would be that over the next
1:06:21
what is it like nine months that Trump's style and message which is admittedly
1:06:27
much more entertaining than DeSantis but kind of fatiguing whether that kind of gets old and DeSantis more like
1:06:35
discipline messaging people just kind of wake up and say you know what like I don't really want to go back to the chaos of of the whole Trump show this
1:06:43
seems like better to me so um that's basically what I think has to
1:06:48
happen is Trump fatigue has to set in and people realize that there's a different was that CNN Town Hall a sign
1:06:55
that some group of people find him incredibly entertaining and the media themselves
1:07:00
want him back because it's great for Ratings Allah Menken on session or
1:07:06
is it a sign that like my God that's so exhausting like you're saying sex what do you think I think that the
1:07:13
the base like the town hall because it was Trump walking into the lion's den and standing up to the mainstream media
1:07:20
which is what they like but I don't think it did anything to help them in the general because I think that viewers
1:07:26
who don't like Trump or aren't entertained by Trump I mean there's nothing there to really grab onto I
1:07:32
don't think so um but but look I think your point about who does the media want to get the
1:07:37
Republican nomination definitely Trump because he's good for Ratings I mean it really is that simple and they think
1:07:43
they can beat him so right now the Biden people the Trump people and the media all want Trump over DeSantis and that is
1:07:52
why like DeSantis is getting dispatched by everybody right now is because
1:07:58
you know everyone's kind of aligned on this but the minute that Trump gets the nomination it's all going to turn the
1:08:04
media all of a sudden is going to turn on Trump and then we're going to see what the real campaign is going to be DeSantis is in show business as they
1:08:10
said on secession was that the quote he show business he's box office he's not Bach yeah DeSantis isn't box office he's
1:08:16
a he's somebody who actually can execute right right but also that's that's why he would be a good move for Republicans
1:08:22
I think is because he doesn't give the Democrats as much to work with yeah all right that Trump's entertaining but he
1:08:27
gives his enemies so much to work with all right another question from the back go ahead stand up tell us your name yeah
1:08:33
uh Sal daher from Boston and uh the
1:08:39
question is much less exciting uh regarding sort of in the problem of of bank bank runs and
1:08:47
Bank insurance by the fed and bailing out uh you know average people bailing
1:08:52
out wealthy people I've heard a lot of solutions about this I've been so careers in banking for a
1:09:00
while um the idea of having Senior Management and the board have direct liability if
1:09:07
the feds have to step in to rescue the bank do you think that that could be a step in the right direction in
1:09:14
preventing Banks from taking risks they really shouldn't have taken I mean the 2008 disaster the subprime crisis could
1:09:20
have been addressed with this I think this crisis with SVP could have been addressed with management just having a
1:09:26
lot more to lose okay so let me just First Take issue with the terminology of bailout I know that's what everyone
1:09:32
calls it a bailout in my mind is when the shareholders the bondholders of the bank get bailed out by taxpayers that
1:09:39
happened in 2008 it did not happen here here the question was whether depositors get made whole or not
1:09:46
I personally don't consider that a bailout I understand there are people who do but it is a slightly different
1:09:51
issue as to the bank management you know uh you're talking about like a strict
1:09:56
liability standard here that I mean basically you're talking about piercing the corporate veil and making
1:10:03
the bank Executives and their directors liable for mismanagement of the bank and
1:10:10
that is that's a pretty high bar that's a really high bar and the problem with it is that I I would never serve on the
1:10:16
board of a bank I mean I probably wouldn't anyway but if you told me that I could be liable piercing the Bell yes
1:10:23
right we have a thing called the business judgment rule you know in Delaware where if directors and officers
1:10:31
of the company perform their job in a good faith way making the best decisions
1:10:37
they can and it goes wrong they're not typically liable for that maybe the corporation's liable if they're not
1:10:43
personally liable I'd like it's if you did that the managers wouldn't invest the cash in
1:10:49
anything because they wouldn't want to take any risk of loss and in order to operate the business which has a bunch of people
1:10:55
working there and a bunch of banks that they got to operate they're going to charge you a fee to hold your money for you and so what happens is interest
1:11:00
rates turn negative and you basically have to pay someone to hold your money for you and that's what's a little bit messed up about the way the banking
1:11:06
system works today is you're effectively giving a money manager the right to invest your money for you they take your
1:11:12
money they pay you a low interest rate and they go invested in high interest rate stuff by taking on risk with your capital and ultimately they can take
1:11:18
losses on that and if you wanted to make them liable for those losses they're not going to take that risk and the bank is
1:11:24
going to have to change its business model from being an Arbitrage business to being a service fee business and
1:11:29
they're gonna have to figure out other ways to charge you service fees including charging you to hold your money in order to make money and that's
1:11:35
what a lot of the banks are now doing first for public and others have now proclaimed that they're going to start charging a lot more service fees to hold
1:11:41
your money and they're going to start taking a lot less risk so we're already headed in that direction but that's fundamentally what I think would let's
1:11:47
take another question from the audience good evening I'm Lisa song Sutton Las Vegas Nevada I'm GP in the veteran fund
1:11:54
as investors you all invest in entrepreneurs theoretically you support American entrepreneurship what role if
1:12:01
any do you think VCS should have in shaping advocating supporting
1:12:07
conservative economic policy in the country Shama zero
1:12:14
I think that we have to know the role that you're doing if you're a venture
1:12:19
investor which is you're buying a deep out of the money option and I think that you want to motivate
1:12:26
the people that you are partnering with to take really thoughtful but outsized
1:12:31
risked and so I don't think there's a lot of room for conservativism I do think that
1:12:38
there's room for misallocation of capital and I think that there's people that can help guide that but the reality is that
1:12:45
when you start a company it's 95 percent likely to fail and the
1:12:51
Venture investor is signing up for a 70 or 80 percent
1:12:56
probability that they lose capital maybe a 10 or 15 or 20 percent chance that they get their money back and then
1:13:02
these small five percent chance that it becomes reasonable so
1:13:07
in that lens I don't think that's where conservative economic policies really
1:13:14
should play a role I think you just kind of got to go for it and if it's gonna win it's going to
1:13:20
win big and if it doesn't you lose one extra money I think like where you want conservative economic and rational
1:13:27
thinking is when you go to the extreme other end which is just like the large-scale decisions that affect the
1:13:35
economic vibrancy of the country in which you live and there on the margins you probably want to be more rational than unrational irrational but as a
1:13:43
venture investor I think you want to be irrational but I also think you have to be very judgmental
1:13:48
and the reality is that most companies aren't going to work and most people
1:13:53
this may seem controversial most people actually when push comes to shove are a
1:14:00
little afraid of the decisions they need to make to be truly successful they're not willing to fire the people
1:14:06
that they need to fire they're not willing to be extreme in the product they want to build they're not willing to price it they're not willing to go to
1:14:12
market in an extreme way and it tends to be that these companies fail because of that a lack of Courage a lack of
1:14:18
conviction it's a lack of courage or conviction because that that's a very heightened word I just think that when push comes to shove most people implode
1:14:25
with the pressure of making a very very hard decision interesting all right in my experience
1:14:31
it could be yours could be no I mean I I agree with you largely when a startup does fail
1:14:37
if the experienced people around it are watching and can't get through to the founder or the founding team it's
1:14:43
typically they are blocking their own success they're unwilling to fire their co-founder their CTO as the example
1:14:49
you're alluding to perhaps or raise the price of the software and lose some customers or to drive people to work
1:14:54
harder because you've got a competitor in the space and that's why you see extreme people win in our Pursuit and I
1:15:02
think there's been just a great fallacy that's gone on that you can have live work balance or life work balance and
1:15:07
you could have this Nirvana where you have it all the fact is the great companies are made by people who make
1:15:13
great sacrifices period full stop and if you're not willing to make the great sacrifice you're not going to have great outcomes hi uh David Samuel earlier
1:15:20
today Jason you had kind of a doomsday or Ai panelist and my question is you guys have been thrust into the public
1:15:26
spotlight and we look at Deep fakes in the next year or two as you talk about you know
1:15:32
tweeting on Friday versus Wednesday how do you think about somebody having each of you saying things that you did
1:15:39
not say and like how might we know whether chamoth said that or it was a
1:15:45
deep fake saying it I already have that problem Insider last week where somebody was
1:15:52
saying I had a phone call I never had so how do we solve this especially for you as public as public two things two
1:15:58
things one I don't think people can say more outlandish and damaging things in AI than we say ourselves
1:16:05
on this podcast at times but uh number two you know as we've discussed many
1:16:10
times on this podcast we have rebooted our trust uh in institutions what we
1:16:17
read what we see and I think people are now assuming they're being manipulated
1:16:22
assuming something might be fake news or doctored and I think it's like people
1:16:27
are building up a much higher resiliency to lies manipulation and if I were to ask a hundred people
1:16:34
what is the bias of CNN New York Times Fox MSNBC NPR
1:16:40
90 out of 100 Americans could describe it almost exactly people are not dumb
1:16:46
this is another fallacy I think we have in this country is that people are dumb and they're going to get suckered people are kind of figuring it out and and
1:16:53
we've seen deep fakes for what five years ten years now and they're like yeah you know Luke Skywalker didn't look
1:16:58
really good in the Mandalorian but there's a kid who redid it and now dolly two is doing it I think we're kind of
1:17:04
inoculating ourselves to what do you think Freebird deep fakes and Truth when the Gutenberg
1:17:10
Press was invented a bunch of fake was printed and people believed it
1:17:16
I don't think the current iteration with deep fakes is very different from any
1:17:23
form of mass media being used
1:17:29
Crusades yeah no I mean but look I mean you're 100 right I don't want to speak
1:17:35
about religion negatively in that way it is one of many institutions of power that leveraged mass media historically
1:17:43
uh to get people to believe things to do things and to ultimately be able to tax
1:17:48
people and get them to provide capital and Labor uh in the interest of those who are in power and the the system of
1:17:55
deep faking is one of a long string of using the current toolkit
1:18:02
um to take mass media and and follow that same track so it will be dealt with in the same way that things have been
1:18:08
dealt with that have been fake news in the past which is that there will be an opposing voice and there will be counter
1:18:15
arguments and there will be debate and it will be rancorous and it will be noisy and it will be hard to discern and
1:18:21
Alternatives will emerge and tools that identify deep fakes will emerge and it will be the same ongoing battle and
1:18:26
seeking of the truth that Humanity has tried to do um since the dawn of mass media you know
1:18:33
yesterday's conspiracy theories are like tomorrow's Pulitzer prizes I always say like if you look at Sinead O'Connor
1:18:39
ripping up the Pope's picture on Saturday Night Live right in protest and saying like the this is the true enemy
1:18:45
they're molesting children and then the Boston Globe and the movie Spotlight is about them decades later uh winning a
1:18:53
Pulitzer for uncovering what anybody who's in the room who's Catholic in the 70s and 80s knew or had heard was going
1:19:00
on and so you know maybe the time frame is shortening between when we're being lied to and when we figure it out I
1:19:06
actually think it's interesting and good because it forces us to find ways to find the truth more effectively and
1:19:13
um you know it kind of without the antagonism I think it's you know it's it's absent what is the truth you don't
1:19:20
you don't force that debate you don't force that question and this will start to reveal ways that we can kind of
1:19:26
find things that are actual evidentiary things versus things that someone told
1:19:31
me with either historically anecdote or innuendo or I'm a person in power or I'm an authority or I'm an expert and
1:19:37
nowadays it's like I'm a piece of media you should believe me or here I'm an image of a person and that's not going
1:19:42
to be the case anymore I am Jeff a full-time corporate VC and part-time Angel um my questions about Ai and higher
1:19:49
education and it's actually some covert parenting advice so you can decide who's that's relevant for
1:19:55
um my son just finished his freshman year of college and I'm questioning what the future is for him in higher
1:20:02
education given all the change that AI is going to have on on every career and every
1:20:08
profession and I'm wondering what advice you'd give to to your child or or someone who's in college right now for
1:20:15
what what's an area of study that won't maybe won't be disrupted by by AI or or
1:20:21
an area that's um AI you'll get leverage from your education
1:20:26
um through AI I think the reality is that most of the existing jobs that we have in the United States
1:20:34
are going to go to lower cost locations that have that tool chain to accelerate
1:20:41
their capability so we're gonna have to reinvent the
1:20:48
workforce and the things that we do over the next 30 or 40 years to stay
1:20:54
relevant that's probably like I think that should just be the operating principle
1:21:00
if you think about it we used to run great call centers okay those call centers were outsourced to the
1:21:05
Philippines in India but in the next you know five or ten years you'll have this
1:21:10
flawless unaccented English or even more yearly perfectly accented English for
1:21:17
the zip code of the person that's calling in so that it sounds like they're talking to somebody that's literally their neighbor
1:21:22
that's like just makes so much sense right so it's like all this stuff is gonna happen where like all these classes of jobs are going to go away I
1:21:29
saw this article where a lawyer two lawyers use chat GPT to submit a legal
1:21:35
brief the problem was that it cited cases that didn't exist and now they're going to be disbarred
1:21:41
so this is like serious business right like you can't do that like that's like real legal
1:21:48
malfeasance so what are your kids practice in college
1:21:53
you know if I had to choose something for my kids I would probably I would probably tell them to do
1:22:00
something mathematical or biological the reason I would Point them to math is
1:22:05
that I think that it's irrefutable there's this Great Clip between Ricky Gervais and Stephen Colbert you guys
1:22:12
should go and Google this but it's a clip where he's on The Colbert Show and Colbert is a deeply devout Catholic and
1:22:20
he's offended by the fact that Ricky Gervais doesn't believe in God and he asked him why don't you believe in God and Ricky gervaises look if we
1:22:27
wiped out all the books in the world in a thousand years everything that's scientific and mathematical would be
1:22:33
re-established but everything that is religious or theoretically not you know mythical if
1:22:39
you want to say would look very very different and that's why I don't believe in God
1:22:45
I'm not trying to question that but it's a way of answering this question which is I would try to point my children to
1:22:51
the body of knowledge that's largely irrefutable which is biological and mathematical versus
1:22:58
belief oriented because I think these tools will change one's beliefs I've been thinking about this a lot too I think teaching them to be
1:23:04
entrepreneurial resilient worldly ability to communicate ability to lead other people
1:23:10
in teams that stuff's not going to go away communication skill et cetera and
1:23:16
I'm encouraging everybody who I work with to just use chat gbt4 and Bard
1:23:21
every day for every single thing that they do my base thesis right now is that
1:23:28
the job freezes the hiring freezes that all these companies is indefinite I'm
1:23:34
assuming it's indefinite because the amount of work it takes to write a job requisition is more work in some cases
1:23:41
than actually automating with AI or ready the job function and so I think 20
1:23:47
person companies might you know double in size in the next two or three years but still have 20 people
1:23:54
this is going to be a big challenge for the for society uh and if it if that does come to pass there's just going to
1:24:00
be large swaths of people who are not going to be able to get job interviews for anything other than service jobs and
1:24:06
you know we need a lot more plumbers electricians waiters et cetera those probably jobs won't go
1:24:11
away if especially if we don't let people immigrate so enthusiastic about that efficient but I
1:24:17
think it also means you have to be entrepreneurial because if you can't get a job and you can't get mentored you
1:24:22
better create your own opportunity you better create your own company and that's what I'm seeing that's the game on the field right now two or three
1:24:28
people who don't have job offers from Uber and Airbnb and Google and Facebook just saying it let's start a company because there's nothing else for
1:24:35
us to do and those are highly skilled people right now doing that I'll say two quick things about this topic so one is
1:24:42
I think there's a lot of AI fear porn out there right now and I just think that like all these Doomer scenarios are
1:24:50
they're not going to play out overnight I mean this is going to take a while second
1:24:56
if you think about like job elimination it's going to be some super specialized
1:25:02
job so for example I wouldn't want to be a radiologist right now but doctors will be fine
1:25:08
so I think if you're thinking about like going into a job category that's super
1:25:14
specialized and clearly in the way of AI then that probably is not a good idea
1:25:20
but most General skills like you're talking about and most job categories
1:25:26
are going to be fine there's just going to be some Specialties within them that make it dislocated like I wouldn't want
1:25:33
to be a truck driver either you know because of self-driving but transportation companies are still going
1:25:39
to exist so I think you just want to be careful about super specialization I
1:25:44
think but building General skills is always really good that really should be the point of college where would you put lawyers and accountants on that I'm
1:25:51
curious they're sufficiently General that I don't think they're going to be eliminated but will they be able to do
1:25:56
five times the amount of work therefore we won't need as many they may be able to get more done yeah I
1:26:01
would expect them to be able to get more done yeah but I don't think necessarily think that means we'll need less of them
1:26:07
I mean the old story about lawyers is that there was one lawyer in a town had
1:26:12
no business second lawyer came to town and they were both more busy than they knew what to do with
1:26:19
lawyers get 30 more productive they file 30 more lawsuits and you know we're good
1:26:24
yeah all right let's take another question these are great questions so far hey guys Rick Spencer um I hope chamoth gets to choose the wine this
1:26:30
evening for dinner I did not get to choose your wine so I apologize in advance
1:26:36
of 2018 uh Brazil I love the bestie okay question so
1:26:43
you've talked recently in in episodes about the speed of AI the adoption and how the winners are still unknown that
1:26:50
was reinforced in the sessions today a room full of investors how are you thinking differently about your investment you know your Strategic
1:26:56
investment decisions and your strategy are there opportunities to look at Venture investing differently like
1:27:01
Venture Studios you know in the future of AI I had this conversation earlier today I think I started a company in
1:27:07
2006. where we took large data sets
1:27:13
and we built predictive models from those data sets and we use those predictive models to make analytical tools available to a specific vertical
1:27:20
in our case agriculture farmers and the models were both deterministic meaning there was kind of
1:27:26
definitions algorithmic definitions of physical parameters and there was like all the statistical inference that you
1:27:32
get from large data sets and it made recommendations for farmers
1:27:38
what a lot of people are calling AI today is fundamentally a predictive
1:27:43
model on text on language I am making a language predictor that
1:27:49
gives you a sentence and it seems so profound because it is how we all interact with computers and interact
1:27:55
with one another and as a result it is kind of viewed as the sea change across all of these
1:28:01
industries instantaneously it's this whole new era but the fact is that generally speaking the digitization of
1:28:08
things and the amount of data that's being generated on Earth is going up by some order of magnitude every number of
1:28:14
months and our ability to make predictions and build predictive models that are useful to specific vertical
1:28:19
segments is improving every sequential cycle that this is happening across every
1:28:25
vertical and it is continued and it hasn't changed and it's not any different so
1:28:30
there's in this area of genomics and bioinformatics there is an absolute sea change happening in human health in
1:28:36
synthetic biology and our ability to understand and predict the biological world and make changes and create new
1:28:42
drugs create new systems for producing molecules for producing things that humans consume and it is all buoyed by
1:28:49
Machine learning applied to large data sets and genomics and other metadata associated with human health and biology
1:28:55
and we're seeing the same thing in other areas whether it's chemistry Material Science
1:29:01
industrial application consumer markets and so on the era of what people are now
1:29:07
calling AI is an interface layer of language that's really creating transformational opportunities on how
1:29:12
these tools how these systems how these models can be utilized and provided to all these different verticals and allows
1:29:18
us to rethink business models to rethink interaction models and to really change the economics of
1:29:24
different businesses and and the utility and the productivity of humans because it is about speech it is about communication it's about what we
1:29:30
fundamentally do as a species so I would argue that the general
1:29:36
trajectory of machine learning the general trajectory of data generation our ability to make predictions generate
1:29:42
value across all these different markets is continuing in the way that it has been continuing for the last 20 years
1:29:48
and it is profound in its own right and I wouldn't say that there's a massive sea change in that Evolution because of
1:29:55
large language models large language models create another set of opportunities so I would kind of create
1:30:01
a distinction and make sure that the categorization of the investment opportunities in large language models be assessed on its own and everyone's
1:30:07
all over the place as you guys probably heard today foundational models are getting disrupted every other week they're being decreased in size
1:30:14
parameters are being reduced they're being commoditized you can run these things on M2 chips everything is up in
1:30:19
the air right now and it's friggin nuts you're going to invest in a company at a 500 million valuation and six weeks later it's going to be worth zero
1:30:25
because someone open source the exact same thing that you can now do for 100k so that's very difficult and very
1:30:31
different than but there are still like these incredible points of inflection happening across all these other other
1:30:36
Industries with respect to machine learning and that's where I spend my time chamathie want to add what you're
1:30:42
looking at I think this is going to be the big question yeah six or seven years ago
1:30:47
there was this Google earnings release where they talked about building their own silicon I've told this story before
1:30:52
but I pinged those guys and I was basically like I just want to meet the team that built the TPU
1:30:58
long story short a year later I put them in business and you know we've been building silicon for this moment for
1:31:05
years it's been really really hard and the reason it's been really really
1:31:11
hard is that Nvidia is just really really good Cuda is very very complete
1:31:19
and it's just very difficult to justify why one would build
1:31:24
once you have something that you think is profound through you know Implement multiple sdks to like multiple points of
1:31:31
silicon just doesn't make any sense that being said I still think you need to be at the absolute bottom of the
1:31:37
stack and the absolute top of the stack I think I'm a little too biased for saying the former
1:31:43
which is I'm hoping that there's vendor diversity in Silicon diversity
1:31:48
because I think it's going to be really important I don't think we want to have a world where Nvidia runs away with it so I think there's investment
1:31:54
opportunity there just because I think everybody should want that to happen and then at the absolute top
1:32:01
friedberg's right that all these foundational models I think
1:32:06
are changing so rapidly that the thing that you want to figure out is like what are you seating it with to drive
1:32:11
learning that's unique and that's a data problem so there's an example that I've given this was a an example given to me
1:32:19
by nikesh Aurora so it's not I'm not going to take credit for it he's a CEO Palo Alto networks but he was telling me
1:32:25
you know when you look at travel the travel space all the public travel
1:32:30
companies are like 300 billion dollars of public market cap Expedia Travelocity
1:32:35
all these companies but they're pure middlemen and they sit on top of a data feed that
1:32:43
comes from a handful of companies one of them is saber and so I went and I looked at saber
1:32:49
saber is like a 1.3 billion dollar company a small little company but they are the ones that go into all
1:32:56
the airlines extract all this gobbledygook data normalize it and allow Expedia Travelocity booking.com to exist
1:33:05
in a world of machine learning where an AI where theoretically you can have conversational languages in inside of
1:33:11
WhatsApp or messenger or Instagram you see this beautiful picture you're like book me a ticket to that place
1:33:18
well saber is actually the key value Creator there and all these
1:33:25
Expedia examples that are plugins of gbt make no sense they make no economic sense those companies should go to zero
1:33:32
so I've used that as a way of forcing function for me to try to prove that there's really these two barbells it's a
1:33:39
barbell bookends one is a silicon and one of these sort of like data providers that's probably an investable thing
1:33:46
that's defensible everything in the middle I think what what feedbrook said is true which is today it looks like
1:33:52
it's worth a couple billion dollars tomorrow's words nothing and so I think you have to be very careful if you listen to there's an
1:33:58
interview that Stephen Wolfram did with Lex Friedman if you guys listen to it a few weeks ago I had them on my pod the
1:34:04
couple weeks people haven't heard they're free from yeah he's incredible yeah he's incredible if you listen to that interview I think Wolfram does a
1:34:09
great job of describing the difference between inferential models or statistical models and computational
1:34:15
models statistical models are where you take large data sets and you build
1:34:20
statistical models that infer and predict things in the future or predict
1:34:26
things that you ask it to predict from the data set that it's trained on and then it creates a statistical
1:34:31
representation it has a probability of being right or wrong and every prediction it makes and it creates a distribution of outputs from the model
1:34:37
and you can train a model from nothing today using a bunch of tools that are open
1:34:43
source and generally available and a bunch of great silicon and all this amazing stuff that's that's that's now out in the world
1:34:48
but there's a bunch of things that you can't generate data and you can't necessarily train models on and that
1:34:54
requires computational models models where you actually have to build some
1:35:00
system that creates a deterministic outcome and deterministic means that it doesn't have a distribution of things
1:35:05
that could happen it has one thing and it calculates it like two plus four is six there isn't a probability
1:35:11
distribution on it being six two plus four is computable it is calculable it is six
1:35:18
the great unlock that I think is ahead of us still generally speaking with
1:35:24
respect to large language models is the connection back to computational models is the connection back to structured
1:35:30
data where you can make requests and integrate structured data into the output combined with inferential output
1:35:36
and computational models where you can take the inference you can take the request and figure out what
1:35:43
computational models can I now run in addition to making a prediction about an output and that's where so much of the
1:35:50
value is going to lie and it's going to require incredible software engineering Talent applied math statistics all the
1:35:57
stuff that's made data science generally speaking so successful over the last two decades is going to continue and it's
1:36:03
going to be this integration between computation an inference and it's going to be
1:36:08
applied in lots of different markets and it's going to be really powerful and we're all going to have our minds blown just in terms of like the seed stage or
1:36:15
super early pre-seed stage two or three people who are obsessed with this technology who are playing with it every
1:36:21
day who are keeping up to speed on it and who understands some customer base whether it's delighting themselves or
1:36:28
delighting some other customer base I'm willing to take that small bet on that 100K to 250k bet
1:36:33
because in the previous Paradigm shifts or platform shifts cloud computing apps
1:36:39
and before that desktop Computing and the web you saw people start tinkering with
1:36:45
stuff and whatever their first two ideas were are long forgotten because they figured something else out and I kind of
1:36:51
feel like that's the stage we're in there were a lot of people who were playing with iPhones in the App Store and you know they made a calculator or a
1:36:58
flashlight that got built into the operating system as um I think Freeburg is specifically pointing out like you could just be part
1:37:05
of the model in your whole business is wiped out we have one company that's trying to make itineraries for travel
1:37:10
and I looked at what they're building and then uh you know they're figuring out prompts they're figuring out the
1:37:16
interface they're figuring out what people want and I did the same searches on chat GP before and I was like it's
1:37:21
not that much better what you're doing but it's better and your ideas are better and so I think that they'll win
1:37:27
the race and they only have to please you know whatever number of users and this company could wind up being
1:37:33
like I said before a 20-person company that does 50 million in revenue and I think that's going to be a very
1:37:38
interesting future and it reminds me of the app economy there were a small number of Acts things like distro kid or
1:37:45
Instagram where small teams built things that printed money and had incredibly High margins so I think that's part of
1:37:52
the opportunity here I do agree with jamaat's Point data is the new oil whatever data set you have that you have
1:37:58
That's Unique is incredibly powerful in terms of defensibility and could help you to outpace one of the generic models
1:38:07
this dude's been waiting okay dude who's been waiting all right lightning round thanks David for the mic my name is
1:38:13
rahid masri with transform VC in San Francisco my question is for you shamath um the last finally Jesus Christ
1:38:21
what the these guys so and the last one or two episodes I
1:38:27
can't recall you um you brought up this whole idea as how do we get non-us born American Patriots run
1:38:34
for president so uh as the growth hacking Drunken
1:38:40
Master uh what do you recommend how do we Propel this idea how do we how did the cup Steam and not have to wait 25
1:38:47
years or whatever you know it can't happen in the next few years I think I do think there's a small probability
1:38:53
could happen in 25 to 30 years but like the problem is that
1:39:00
the people that only jaycal can be president on the stage by the way yeah the three of us that's how up
1:39:06
this is but I'll put you guys in my cabinet positions I think the how is
1:39:11
that you have enough Bottoms Up citizen journalism
1:39:17
and opinion formation that people can independently decide
1:39:22
that on the margin this is a good idea like look I I'm not interested in running for government but if David were
1:39:29
in charge of something very important treasury or state I would have immense
1:39:34
confidence if Friedberg were in charge of something I would have immense confidence so the idea that guys like
1:39:41
this foreign the idea that guys like this and oh
1:39:46
because I'm born here so you don't have to say that yeah yeah don't worry you'll get the Department of Sanitation no so
1:39:53
for sure General I do think it's a little it's a little
1:39:59
crazy that guys like these two get disqualified just because they emigrated
1:40:05
when they were like four and six that's insane so I I think that if we're in the
1:40:12
business of actually deciding that you want the best people for this country on the court so that we keep winning
1:40:18
championships you don't tell Jonas oh you know you were born in Greece so ciao you don't
1:40:24
get to play that's crazy put them on the court and let them win
1:40:30
so I do think it takes 25 or 30 years though of us saying this because it has to be a Groundswell of people that say I
1:40:37
just want to win because I'm seeing all these other countries starting to win more and I don't think I want that for my children I think I did I do think it
1:40:43
takes a generation I don't think it happens today all right guys in a couple of hours it will be
1:40:50
the Sultan of science's birthday and Alan keedings and Alan Keating and yeah
1:40:55
that's right so I thought it would only be fitting if a hundred all in super fans took a
1:41:04
moment I'm gonna sing in Italian and son happy birthday to Dave freeberg three
1:41:12
two one happy birthday
1:41:20
to you happy birthday
1:41:31
to you and many more all right Sultan of science
1:41:38
I know your wish was to be a top 10 podcaster it's come true finally I'm quick I gotta go into podcasting yes
1:41:46
[Music] amazing thank you thank you Ashley
