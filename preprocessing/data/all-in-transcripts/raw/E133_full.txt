Bestie intros: Chamath flies public + Poker recap
0:00
I'm so tired I've slept six hours in three and a half days six hours
0:05
so wait wait I went to the World Series of Poker with helmets so you spent no no first of all
0:11
I flew public took Southwest what yeah cost me 49. yeah cause I got a ticket
0:18
for 49 bucks it's like so incredible did you sit in seat A1 also known as Jake owl's Reserve seat it has
0:24
my name on it Moe's in the front row yeah it's great like Southwest has these numbers first class on Southwest no no
0:32
no no premium plus he was in the front row no there's like these signs that that like have a number that attaches to
0:39
your ticket and then you stand in that line and then you go on in this orderly way and so I was I had like A5 or
0:45
something so I was like the fifth person on and then I sat in the front and I put my bags up top yeah you carried your
0:52
backs yeah an hour later I was in Vegas it was so easy Southwest is phenomenal and then I flew back anyways and after
0:58
after losing as much money as I did it felt good to fly for 49 so I gotta be honest with you well austerity measures
1:05
you can sleep better at night with austerity measures and did you go to the all-you-can-eat buffets ticket to go as
1:11
well no I'd never do that you never know [Music]
1:17
Rain Man David said we open source it to the fans and
1:24
they've just gone crazy [Music]
1:30
why did you fly Southwest why did I Fly Southwest well the planes in Europe with Nat that's number one and then two
1:36
I just wanted some flexibility to get in and out depending on when I busted these tournaments so let me tell you about these tournaments
1:43
the 100K is literally like a murderer's row of like every great poker Pro so it
1:50
was like 96 of us or something I got to be honest with you it was so much fun
1:57
so much fun why how so you know that we play 40 minute levels and you have to
2:03
really get the chips moving which means that there's only so much like you know Game Theory optimal poker you can play
2:09
and at some point you just gotta gamble it up and you gotta take your shots and you have to be willing to Bluff and you
2:14
know you have to bet for thin Equity it's so much fun and then you see some of these guys that just lose their minds
2:20
anyways it was it was really really a lot of fun I finished in the middle of the pack like 40 second or something so
2:27
that was brutal but then the thing that I'm the most proud of is and I went from that and I hopped in the 3K six
2:32
six-handed right afterwards and there was like 1250 people in that and I got to 81st and whoa the problem was I just
2:40
couldn't get anything going I couldn't get any real car like you need some card distribution like you have to at some
2:45
point yes make some hands you can't just you know I could Bluff my way to 81st but I needed hands to really to really
2:52
really have a chance to chip up and run it then I played in the Raz which is seven card stock low
3:00
there's 126 people now when I finished in the middle of the pack there and then this 10K Bounty there's about 600 people
3:06
and I finished like 150. those are all respectable I mean I know play tournaments I have no idea how to play
3:12
tournament to be honest I know how to play poker I know how to play cash games but tournaments are very different so I feel like I was very ill prepared but I
3:19
had so much fun and you know the crazy thing is when you're playing for 12 hours a day you are focused for 12 hours
3:26
the thing that I forgot is that you end up I ended up losing like two and a half
3:31
pounds oh wow if your brain is going going biggest thing and I was I was
3:39
mentally devastated at the end of each night you're just lying in bed eyes awake yep and then you can't sleep and so then you know you go and you play
3:45
craps and bakra break the casino for a couple hundred times a night there and then we'll go back to bed that's great sounds like a
3:52
great week the good news is uh as Phil was live blogging for you on your behalf from uh over your
3:59
shoulder by the way the other thing was I brought my phone but I don't have anything on my phone like I don't have Twitter I don't have any of that stuff
4:05
so I was just totally in the zone it felt so great to not be connected to
4:10
social flow experience it's a flow experience when you can turn it very often just be in the moment congratulations on the on the you know
4:17
coming in the 10 of the field and the 3 000 or eight percent of the field that's incredible dude if I really practice at
4:22
these tournaments I think I would Bank a couple but I just don't have the time the Paradox there is that you did best in the largest field if you can do this
4:29
for three or four years and you go into those Razz Fields when it's 100 or those 25k 100ks when it's 100 200 people in
4:37
the 100K there's 90 95 96 people like you really do have about a one percent shot of winning the thing which is
4:43
pretty incredible yeah Raz too Raz is always a hundred I love tournament poker that was my that was my game back in the
4:51
day that's because it's because you're afraid to lose money so it's perfect for you put up a small amount of money and you can play for many hours you're
4:56
probably in your mind you're probably dividing the number of hours by your buy-in so that you can think about what your hourly cost is I actually like
5:03
tournament poker because when you lose you lose like you can't just yeah rebound basically and then there's a
5:09
broader macro strategy you start to play the chips against the other players because you know how everyone else is
5:14
playing based on how many chips they have in front of them it's a great point this theory of ICM which is like independent ship model is exactly what
5:20
you just said the craziest thing Freeburg happens right at the money bubble these guys start I've never seen
5:26
this before they Ultra tank ultrade oh yeah they go in the tank for two minutes and then they fold so obnoxious
5:33
when I used to play tournament poker I'd sit I'd fold Ace King suited you'd fold pocket Queens you'd fold everything if
5:40
you're on the Bubble Level of getting into the money or you're on the bubble or getting to the final table it just doesn't matter because if there's three
5:46
guys with you that have smaller chip Stacks let them get blinded off and now you're in the money or now you're on the
5:51
final table and then you'll play poker it's like go get up go have some dinner I'm back in an hour don't even look at
5:56
your cards if you can Cruise your way there it's a totally different kind of game totally different there's a guy
6:02
that was tanking he's a really lovely guy a British guy I offered him the Min cash just just not tank I was like
6:09
please stop taking for four minutes and folding around I'll just needed his action I had a guy do this in a
6:15
tournament and I timed it with the rest of the table I took out my phone I timed it and I said whatever number of seconds
6:21
you do I'm doubling and I just did that it was so obnoxious
6:27
that the entire table like the guy finally stopped well in the in the 100K we actually had a better setup which is
6:32
that we had these iPads on the table and everybody gets a 30 second shot clock so you can't really around but then in
6:39
these big field events they're not going to have iPads on 100 tables obviously yes and so
6:46
instead people just tank forever and then you have to call the floor and you have to call time on these folks the
6:51
funniest thing though was like the last tournament I bought in for was a 10K secret Bounty which means that on day two when you knock somebody out you
6:58
actually everybody stops the action you go up on stage and you pull like out of it's like treasure hunting some of these
7:04
bounties can be like a million bucks and obviously there's a lot of people there that kind of recognize me and when they
7:11
saw me in the 10K secret bounty there was like a movement it was so funny they were like if you win the secret Bounty
7:18
and you win the million we're gonna revolt and burn the Paris Paris
7:25
and I and I thought you know it's true it'd be patently unfair if I was the one that won that million dollar secret value how many selfies did you take on
7:31
Southwest that's the question everybody wants to know how many people recognize you on Southwest and what was the shame
7:37
that you felt that's great I'm Gonna Fly I'm Gonna Fly Southwest to Vegas all the time now it's great it I
7:43
literally was honestly to get from my house to the gate where you stand to get into the plane it was like clustered
7:49
maybe 15 minutes more than just driving on the tarmac like it was a nothing Burger check out it's amazing what a down
7:56
Market could do to people you know what this is what is it Brad this is the victory of the age of
8:02
fitness Southwest you were in the first the
8:09
first 30 minutes you were the front row Southwest all right listen there's a big docket today we've got a lot on the
FED pauses hikes momentarily, IPO window status, state of the market
8:14
plate David sacks is busy in a Star Chamber right now selecting the next president of the United States he's
8:20
picking a VP in the cabinet for whoever's gonna win so he couldn't make it today so we brought the fifth bestie Brad gerstner back and great timing
8:27
because the FED decided to pause rate hikes in just yesterday I guess and this would
8:33
have been the 11th consecutive rate hike is that about right that's right and they anticipated
8:40
two more 25 bases hikes before the end of the year so here's just the um fed
8:46
funds effective rate so you can all can see it here over time and there was also some big news this week
8:52
a couple of 20 23 IPO candidates started to be floated obviously we've
8:59
been hearing about Reddit and tripe for a while but arm confidentially filed for an IPO back in April and they're seeking to raise
9:05
between 8 and 10 billion later this year and that would be uh a pretty big deal for SoftBank
9:12
which owns The Firm and that could I guess save SoftBank which has had a just a brutal
9:19
run with the two different opportunities save softbanks the arm
9:25
deal is being done is what's the valuation that's being done at SoftBank acquired on for 32 billion in 2016. they
9:31
don't know the valuation right now they haven't put that out there yet I mean they were originally looking for anywhere from 30 to 70 but I mean Brad
9:37
where do you think that comes out I have no idea I think that you know they're shopping to get these
9:43
anchor tenants into arm if the IPO Market was super hot and this
9:49
was really easy to get done this would have been done you know so I think you know they're tiptoeing now because they
9:55
need to get it into the public market but you know I I think that anybody who
10:01
does an IPO today okay is going to demand a you know a rate of return into that
10:10
offering that is a significant margin of safety relative to all deals that were done in
10:16
20 and 21. and what that means is on the road show investment Banks go and
10:22
they try to drum up demand they want to have anchors in the IPO book they call firms like ours they call Strategic
10:28
investors they want to size up what that is and you know they give you their
10:34
expectation of fair value or where they think the IPO will trade to of course you meet with management you
10:40
ascertain and develop your own expectations of fair value what I'm saying is maybe in the peak
10:47
you know in 20 and 21 people were getting thinner and thinner in terms of the margin of safety they demand I my
10:54
expectations whether it's arm whether it's data bricks or other companies that are starting to queue up and these are
11:00
fantastic companies right make no mistake about it Nvidia tried to buy arm and you know databricks is doing over a
11:06
billion in Revenue growing extraordinarily fast led by an incredible team but in order to get into
11:12
the public markets they have to you know step in with a bigger discount than they would of
11:17
you know previous correction and uh just to put some numbers on it arm had agreed to be acquired by Nvidia
11:24
for 40 billion before the talks fell through that was due to regulatory scrutiny Bloomberg says arm is aiming
11:29
for evaluation of 70 billion obviously there's no confirmation about that that's just the news hopefully intelligently speculating about it what
11:36
exactly would you be buying for 70 billion dollars I thought they missed it yeah arm had a window where they had to
11:43
make some really important product decisions to be able to actually have reference designs that actually made
11:48
sense Beyond just simple mobile processors and CPUs and they don't have any of that so they have a good Cash Cow
11:55
business it's probably worth 25 billion they paid 30 some odd 32. yeah they
12:01
could have gotten it out for 40 something but it's a mid-20s billion dollar company no more
12:06
and if you're in if if you buy it at the 20s you're buying a cash flow yielding asset and the good luck to all the
12:13
players I guess is what I would say clearly it's a function of soft Bank seeking liquidity right I mean they uh
12:19
they've had this position for how many years now four years no more I think this was six
12:27
maybe six years yeah when did they buy it was it 2016 I think it was longer yeah 2016. they bought it so this has
12:34
been and in the physical Center ending march the vision fund alone took a 32 billion dollar write down
12:40
obviously SoftBank has a big chunk of the vision fund but this is not in division and it's not in the vision fund
12:47
exactly yeah but it's clearly uh liquidity
12:53
driver for them I don't think that this is you know first of all Jason I don't think the point about SoftBank needs
12:58
saving is necessarily true it's not a company that needs saving but they've certainly taken some hits well they could use a win this is what my
13:04
point yeah yeah they could use a win but the last two uh quarterly calls you know
13:12
was pretty repentant and humble right in fact he used that exact language we
13:18
talked about it here so there's a big liquidity need at some point for the business so they can get this thing out
13:23
and get liquid on it it would certainly support the balance sheet more than anything you know the the market is on a tear this year Brad
13:30
is there now that everybody's buying back into tech stocks I guess two
13:36
questions why is everybody suddenly buying into tech stocks when people
13:41
think there's going to be a recession and consumers have run out of money and
13:48
yeah what what's the thinking here of why so much money has gone to Tech and this incredible rally it's been great to
13:54
watch but uh people seem to be perplexed by the rally and then the FED even though they didn't do a rate hike seem
14:01
to put cold water on and say Hey listen don't get ahead of yourselves we're gonna probably do rate hikes later in the year we all have short memories
14:08
you know Tech had a devastating year in 2022 so this is a bit of a reversion to
14:13
the mean right if you remember the chart we you know we showed a lot on this pod last year at the at the end of starting
14:19
at the end of 2021 was that we were trading at you know multiples that were
14:25
you know 50 to 70 percent above their 10-year average um and at the trough we were trading
14:31
about 30 to 40 below the 10-year average right so the market corrected it overshoots on the upside because rates
14:37
went to zero and by the end of 2022 when you had Larry Summers and others who were going out and saying we don't know
14:44
what the upper bound of inflation and rates is that's really scary to the
14:50
markets and so you had this overshoot to the downside we're still trading below the 10-year average for internet and
14:56
software companies based upon our numbers and so when you look at this as we said at the end of last year the
15:02
framework changed early in this year all of 22 was about two things is inflation
15:09
going higher and our rates going higher and those things are debilitating for growth assets and growth multiples by
15:16
the beginning of this year we started to have confidence that inflation had peaked which meant that rates were
15:23
largely in kind of you know spitting distance of their final destination and
15:29
the framework shift to economy are we going to have a hard Landing now remember at the start of the Year Mike
15:35
Wilson from Morgan Stanley who made give him credit made the call in 2022 he said
15:40
22 was going to be awful he was right but he stayed in that bearish position at the beginning of 2021 said the
15:48
economy is going to hit the skids in q1 and that we're going to revisit 3 000 or
15:53
3200 on the S P instead we're sitting at 4 300. so he was tragically wrong at the
16:00
beginning of this year because again he was fighting I think the last battle that he that was one as opposed to
16:07
looking ahead and saying this is no longer about rates and inflation so the NASDAQ has moved 30 percent to start
16:13
this year you know the FED said yesterday um we're hitting pause um you know the quote uh from chairman
16:20
Powell that has everybody a little bit perplexed because on the one hand he says we're data dependent on the other
16:26
hand he said we're likely to have more rate hikes right and the rates are going
16:33
to stay high for a couple years well if we're dated you can't have it both ways if we're data dependent we have a hard
16:39
Landing like Stan drucken Miller thinks we're going to have in Q4 this year then rates are going to get caught
16:46
but the market seems to like this and let's talk about where we are the 10
16:51
years at about 3 7 the s p is basically flat in terms of where it was and where it
16:57
was before and where it was after the rate hike announcement the economy
17:02
appears to be reasonably good 80 percent of earnings in q1b the guides were okay
17:08
Stan druckenmiller said I shifted you know he pulled forward when he thought
17:14
we were going to have a hard Landing based upon the bank crisis which now feels like it's a distant memory for
17:19
many and he's now calling for potentially a hard Landing in Q4 so the
17:25
FED just came out and said no we're not going to have a hard Landing in Q4 we think we're going to have one percent growth
17:31
they think that inflation to end the year is going to be at 3.2 percent versus the 3.7 percent Goldman consensus
17:38
what I would say is you know we've moved but we're still below the 10-year average but you have to start paying
17:45
attention now to individual stocks that have likely gotten ahead of themselves or where they've taken that's an example
17:51
of that a lot of the return Facebook no Microsoft you know I think a
17:58
lot of the AI related stocks are at or within 10 of our end-of-year price
18:04
Target and when you when you see that take something like Nvidia if I'm playing at
18:10
home or I'm a you know a professional investor I may say oh I'm going to go sell some long dated calls to buy a
18:16
little protection to the downside I don't think there's any problems with Nvidia I think they're going to continue to perform I think they're beat their
18:23
numbers for the balance of the year but you know remember at the start of the Year people thought they were going
18:28
to miss their numbers for data center people thought data center revenues this year were going to be negative and they
18:35
just revised their guide from 7 billion in Q2 to 11 billion in Q2 so they've
18:42
absolutely blistered their numbers and the Stock's gone from 125 dollars
18:47
you know to over 400 so when you have those parabolic moves just like we did
18:53
with rates last year I think it's wise to say it's a fantastic company we want to be involved it's going to continue to
18:59
be one of our larger positions but if I can lock in 20 yield by selling calls
19:05
six months out I think that's a reasonable risk reward so you know I think that's where we are
19:11
and now now the question really becomes and it's unknown and unknowable right are we going to have a soft
19:17
Landing a medium Landing a hard landing and Q4 and rolling into next year and I would say as an investor I'm very data
19:24
dependent you know we're talking to companies what data point should we all be looking at at this point you think
19:29
jobs unemployment just these stocks in their multiples and how are you looking
19:35
at it as a capital allocator to month still on the sidelines what if I said like a broken record rates are going to
19:41
be higher than you want and they're going to be around for longer than you like and now Powell is basically telling you
19:47
the same thing so we're almost at the end of I think the
19:54
bottoming though I don't agree with drucken Miller I think he's wrong on which part that
20:00
doesn't be a hard Landing in Q4 yeah yeah and the reason there's not going to be a hard Landing is you just saw China
20:06
today basically say we're going to start to rip in trillions of dollars they're going to stimulate the economy you can't have a hard Landing when China's
20:12
printing trillions of dollars not possible so I think that what Powell was forecasting is that if China starts to
20:19
basically turn on the money printer and go through a huge Spate of quantitative easing
20:26
it's going to just inflate everything because they're just such a critical artery to the world economy and so you
20:33
just have to get prepared for rates just being sticky and inflation being sticky
20:38
and I think that that's probably the most reasonable base case for the rest of the decade rest of the Decades seven
20:44
more years yeah yeah and so in that environment
20:49
the problem is that now you have the seven or eight most valuable tech stocks priced to Perfection yet again
20:56
if you look at their Enterprise Value over their net income these things are trading at astronomical yields that
21:03
are less than half of the two-year note and now approaching sometimes less than
21:08
half of the 10-year note government bonds that makes no sense
21:14
and if you subtract out those seven or eight biggest companies in the S P 500 the s p
21:20
has not been a great asset so the I think the equal weighted index Brad you probably know the exact number
21:27
the equal weighted index is just so what does all this mean I think it means that people are psychologically
21:34
exhausted with having lost money they are psychologically wanting to Will the Market up they want to
21:39
psychologically believe whatever will allow them to
21:46
influence rates getting cut but I think the most reasonable bear cases rates aren't getting cut and
21:51
whatever I hope you had of rates getting cut just went out the window today because there is no world in which you cut rates when China is going to print a
21:57
trillion dollars free bird a lot of people seem to think that uh this big run up in the markets is AI related everybody's got an AI
22:05
angle for their company some of them super valid like Microsoft and Google other ones feels kind of speculative we
22:12
talked about BuzzFeed talked about having AI journalists in their stock which is looks like it's going to be
22:18
delisted got a quick pop do you think the AI
22:23
AI actually coming to Market driving efficiency driving revenue for companies
22:28
is going to happen in the short to mid term or is it more like midterm to long term in other words is the AI rally
22:35
overheated and fake I don't know if I would assume that the
22:41
pricing of equities is entirely driven by AI I think there's a lot of factors
22:48
including a lot of folks maybe being on the sidelines for too long and needing to come and buy in at the same time but
22:57
I do think that there's a radical realization underway that a lot of businesses
23:05
that are dependent on services that might be replaced by AI don't necessarily have the longevity today
23:11
those are businesses that have been severely hurt by the point of view of what AI could
23:17
bring to Market and bring to Industry there's a lot of stuff happening on the short side on the long side I think it's
23:25
a distribution curve unlike how quickly different Industries will be affected in a positive way by AI
23:32
certainly the most obvious is demand for chips is all this infrastructure is being built out so that's the first and
23:39
so you know with a high discount rate which is the environment we're in today you can more quickly bet on those
23:45
opportunities and so you see a disproportionate bubbling evaluation in multiples on businesses like that there
23:51
are other businesses that are further down like Services businesses how long
23:57
until lawyers are able to leverage AI how long until Banks investment banks are going to be leveraging AI to create
24:04
new products and improve their margins there's a lot of speculation a lot of ideas but the discount rate is quite
24:09
high right now and that's probably a few years out to the point that the fuzziness wipes out the potential value
24:15
what you mean by the discount rate in this context so let's say that I think that investment banks are going to be
24:20
severely changed in seven to ten years that's the time Horizon I think that their business is going to improve
24:26
because of AI as an example or you know Factory Machinery automation right
24:32
manufacture structuring businesses probably 10 to 15 years so I can't really give them that much credit today
24:38
and so I apply a higher discount rate there but there are other industries that are certainly being affected much
24:43
more quickly and you know I'm sure Brad and his his team of of uh Finance Wizards
24:49
probably have a board you know where they have this list of all the industries they're going to be affected and what time Horizon I mean that's the
24:55
way you could kind of think about this and over different time Horizons you could kind of accrue some net Improvement to earnings and say okay you
25:02
apply a discount rate to that here's how much the stock should trade up and and you know that's one way to kind of think
25:07
about this I don't think it's everything everywhere all at once great drop uh great reference Brad great
Film, cold plunge, and sauna talk
25:13
by the way I I got to tell you I just saw that movie I have to reference it because I saw it over the weekend have you seen that movie of course of course
25:20
yeah what an unbelievable film I had not seen that film I had very clearly postponing it incredible anyway uh what
25:28
is it what movie it's uh everything everywhere all at once it won best picture not the Oscars last year
25:35
I don't trust the best picture awards at the Oscars for a few years I've just been duped by that award like you get
25:41
some really crap ass movies that are like uh watch this movie and then report back let's I won't even tell you more
25:47
politically correct or whatever and then they get this little virtue signaling they were doing a little catch up because of Oscar so white the movement
25:54
to try to balance things out in fact people well that doesn't exactly reinforce trust that actually destroys
26:00
complete trust and reputational credibility yes they're uh virtuous and actually that was something people said
26:06
that everything everywhere all at once was possibly uh because it's an Asian cat I don't even know what is it what is
26:12
it it's a Sci-Fi Adventure surrealist kind of romp Michelle yo is in it uh
26:19
she's very famous from Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon correct exactly yeah
26:25
who played Short Round in Indiana Jones yep
26:32
impersonation but I would get canceled for doing the impersonation of him in that that guy must be like 70
26:38
years old no yeah no he's like he's like something but it's pretty great because he also won
26:45
best actor best supporting actor and there were all these pictures of him with Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg
26:53
the guys that made it are like music video directors you got to go see this film it's really good it's it's on a
26:59
visual basis watch it on Apple TV in one of your
27:05
theaters tonight
27:15
I ever had I go to the bathroom you know it's a long flight back from Italy so I'm taking my time and I see
27:23
that ASAP as sub soap that I can't afford it's like a hundred peso yeah
27:28
that one okay so I see that and I'm like wait a second so I look in the cabinet underneath I'm like if there's two up here there's got to be six down below so
27:35
I check in the galley of course there's six down there I put two I boost two on my back which I'm still not through in
27:42
my uh bathroom here that's about 300 bucks and I check out he's got a TV set up so
27:49
I'm like oh I wonder what movies are on here and it's Netflix he's got so much bandwidth on that freaking plane
28:01
all right let's get back to work here right have you seen it by the way have you seen that movie yeah it's incredible movie
28:08
it's not the best film of the year that was tar but I don't want to get into it with chuma
28:13
oh my God I tried to watch tar that movie sucks balls it was so boring
28:19
and self-absorbed and controlled that's what I like about it for anybody
28:25
that has sleeping issues and otherwise needs to use a sleeping aid I would just put that movie on because you know once
28:31
you see Kate Blanche had blathering on and walking back and forth from her kids school and then some crappy
28:37
piano play you'll fall asleep what puts you to bed faster chamoth
28:43
Ambien tar or science corner or science Corner
28:48
which one I actually love science Corners I don't take I don't take sleep aids I've taken Ambien three times in my
28:54
life yeah but that was recreationally during the day it was prescribed to me because I wanted to try it I also tried
29:00
Lunesta once they were they're both like be careful with that stuff man you'll start tweeting weird be careful I
29:07
tried those sleeping aids four times in my life and you wake up I wake up with a it has a really bad tail effect so like
29:13
you wait I woke up I wake up super groggy I only get five or six hours of sleep with it so anyways I uh I do take
29:20
melatonin and that's really good that works that's natural and it does the trick does the trick for me everybody on
29:26
melatonin all of a sudden like everybody I know takes melatonin are you just a natural way to ease into sleep yeah for
29:32
me what I do is like I use it as part of a routine where like typically around 10 like all the you know devices things get
29:40
silenced and do not disturb mode and I'm in a really restful place by 10 o'clock and then usually by 10 15 to 10 30 I'm
29:47
out like a light I just like this infrared sauna you guys have infrared saunas this is like the
29:52
new hotness and uh man that is incredible uh you get a heart rate goes way up and then you sleep like a baby
29:58
okay let's get back to AI Brad are people getting too much credit in their stock prices and is the do you do
30:05
contrast therapy after the infrared sauna I don't know what contrast RP is what is that meaning when you do the hot
30:10
then you jump into like an ice bath no I'm getting an ice bath of course next for my little outdoor sauna area and I'm
30:17
going to start doing that I did that with my friend Antonio friend of the pot Antonio gracias he's got one of those
30:22
cold plunges we jump in the cold plunge together he's got this thing at 45 freaking degrees he says don't try to do too much he'll
30:29
have a heart attack so I go in I get 45 seconds in I start breathing like really
30:35
heavily and I'm like I could get the hell out of here he does six minutes I do four minutes three times a week
30:43
what temperature what temperature 42 to 44. the research paper that everybody references now I think her name is
30:49
Suzanne's Soderberg or something like that she's the Swedish researcher huberman did it on his podcast that
30:56
Rogan did it anyways the the data is like an out like a little less than an hour
31:02
of heat and 11 minutes of cold per week per week was shown to be physiologically
31:08
optimal so I do it three times a week 20 minutes of heat followed by four minutes of of cold plunge three times a week do
31:15
you have like a cold plunge where you set the dial on it or is it no no I just call water in no I do old school I uh I
31:21
use the Mr steam in my bathroom because like after I'm done working out the last thing I want to do is schlep outside
31:27
find my slippers put on a robe I'm not gonna do any of that so I walk upstairs I do the mistress team at like 110
31:33
degrees and then while I'm working out somebody just makes an ice bath for me and ah nothing
31:40
put a bunch of ice in the tub fill it with water and just jump in it so that what do they do they carve like a bunch
31:46
of baby seals in ice and then they just when you get pushed all the ice cubes were made to look like my Chase so I
31:52
have these shapes just like advice of yourself so I'm like looking at myself yeah no infrared gets up to like 130 140
32:00
degrees and your heart rate will go up to 140 150 degrees in this it's a whole different experience than the Mysteries
32:06
I was recently on a ski trip yeah and it's a this extraordinary sauna it's
32:12
Wood Fired okay you told me about this so so the lead guide on this trip we go
32:19
down there he gets the thing heated up before we show up right and I show up with this great athlete down there and
32:24
we go in the hot box because you know this is the thing to do yeah and I look at the thermostat I think it's broken
32:31
it feels like it's hard pegged at like 225 degrees Fahrenheit that's a lot you
32:38
walk in you're I mean you slow cook meat at 225.
32:43
my lips are burning you know and this this person sitting in there is like now
32:48
this is the way you do it right tough guys you know do it at this temperature we're like all right so you know we sit
32:54
in there for like 10 10 minutes and then we go and we jump in you know in a frozen lake and about 10 minutes later
33:00
we're taking off we had to leave this particular place and you know people are waving goodbye and they're looking you
33:07
know they have to look over the sauna as they're waving goodbye and they notice that the sauna is on fire ah yeah that's
33:15
basically what happens when you go to 220. people are taking this a bit to the
33:22
exynos it's a little crazy all right so back to back to the docket here AI yeah are people getting too much credit in
AI's impact on tech and growth stocks surging, Google's position, AI's "$20T question"
33:28
public markets kind of running with this before it's actually ready for prime time time just to add to freeburg's
33:34
point here there are a lot of people talking about doing things in startups I see people actually doing things I would
33:39
say four out of five startups that we've invested in and the majority of them that we're being pitched on right now
33:45
are not only talking about AI which they were all talking about it three years ago they're actually implementing it now
33:50
because the tool sets are available I just had a call thank you Freeburg for putting me in touch with the Google people I just did a call this past week
33:57
with Google and they gave me some previews of what they're working on I can't say anything about it but it's it's mind-blowing I think Google's not
34:04
as Far Behind Closed AI That's your read on Google now we had a little kerfuffle when I when I talked about sundar's
34:10
reaction to you know Ai and the concerns that others might have on folks talking about the
34:17
company I mean what's your point of view on Google today I don't know if you've talked about this yeah yeah no
34:23
well I mean I think you know I had this I had this dinner this incredible dinner actually Thursday at the pub and you
34:29
know it's how I know Silicon Valley is back because it was just like serendipitous we threw it together in the afternoon you had this like poor
34:36
extraordinary you know CEOs there and you know you had Mustafa the one of the
34:42
co-founders Deep Mind there and Rich Barton from expedienzo it's just just an incredible group and the 20 trillion
34:48
dollar question is how does the entire open architecture of the web get
34:53
re-architected in the age of AI another way of ask asking the question because we're all kind of playing small
34:59
ball right we're all talking about oh you know our tpus but gpus you know and who what Cloud's going to get
35:05
accelerated that's kind of the small ball the big ball here the 20 trillion dollar question that is defined the
35:12
entire internet for our entire careers has been web search
35:17
and I will tell you that the conversation around that table there's increasing confidence that whatever
35:24
comes next right the top of the funnel is up for grabs and all of those dollars
35:30
over a period again a five years seven years is going to get redistributed and
35:35
make no mistake Google is well positioned to make its claim for that
35:40
but its claim is going to come at the expense of search and so Google May
35:46
create the best AI in the world but it's going to have to fight off the cannibalization of course search and the
35:53
question is in this new thing and so rich Barton you know an incredible product founder right think about
36:00
Expedia Zillow yes and Zillow so he's founder of Expedia and founder of Zillow two vertical search engines that
36:07
dominated right their particular verticals and the topic of the conversation was that the new UI right
36:14
the new way you interact with your customers right right is not optimizing
36:19
a web page it's not optimizing an application he calls it the race to
36:25
intimacy the race to intimacy that you have to build a conversational UI I've run that
36:31
race a few times and no and it's a related race okay Sprint not a marathon
36:38
sometimes it's been American and the penultimate question is who ends up on top yeah are you always
36:45
on top this is I I run a really good middle distances and then if I need to just
36:51
make it you know run a Boston Marathon I can if I want but I don't know okay yeah sure you can yeah but I think you know I
36:57
took a poll does he think sorry does he think Zillow is dead I mean he's no longer a shareholder I'm guessing I mean
37:03
he's the CEO he's the chairman sorry sorry not zero sorry not Zillow Expedia pardon me what does he think about
37:08
Expedia and travel well you know you and I had this conversation girly chimed in the cash chimed in on Twitter well
37:13
you're not on Twitter but they chimed in you know about the conversation from
37:19
last week's pod every Vertical Search Engine and Google itself that
37:24
architecture is suspect right the questions just over what timeline is it
37:30
suspect but the world is moving past 10 Blue Links information retrieval that
37:35
looked like a card catalog is not where we're going you no longer need an index you need someone to do the retrieval
37:41
from the index for you that's the the new service extract the knowledge that's what I mean it's personalized to you but
37:48
I think one of the questions that's still outstanding from an architectural point of view in terms of your interaction with all the data in the
37:55
world is are you as a user going to have a number of independent relationships
38:01
with your travel search engine so your travel agent or are you going to have a relationship with your doctor medical
38:06
office and you're going to have a separate relationship with your you know Financial advisory
38:12
type service or are you going to end up seeing similar to The Challenge we have in search versus Vertical Search today
38:18
an aggregator of services because there's value in Cross populating the
38:23
data and the knowledge about you across those services so yeah sure you know it's going to be the no it's going to be
38:29
the former because like obviously there's value to the company because every company wants to profiteer from
38:36
you and monetize you in nine different ways and maximize the equity for their employees and their Founders and their
38:43
board and their shareholders but that's not what people want right so like for example when you go to a doctor would
38:48
your doctor be better off if you know she also had all of your data from I don't know pick your other service
38:55
providers of course maybe you could make a claim that if they had all of your personal information and they understood
39:01
your risk factors they could do a much better job but the reason you don't do that is you want some segregated
39:07
relationships a it gives you some level of privacy but mostly it gives you control in a world of AI where you can
39:12
be more conversational the idea that humans will want to get reduced to talking to one thing for everything
39:19
I think is wrong I think instead it's actually going to be hyperpragmented because the best-in-class use cases are
39:27
going to be the things that people want and then B it gives the user control the
39:32
one thing I would tell people is do not give up all of your data to one thing
39:37
who's professing to be at all they are going to lie to you and trick you and you're going to have a social media
39:43
problem writ large all over again there's another way to think about this which is the reverse of the client server model where today you as you are
39:51
the client you are the node on the network and you're communicating with the center of the network which is the
39:56
server which is the service provider and all the data sits there and you're getting data in and out of their product
40:02
to suit your particular objectives but the future may be that more data is aggregating and accruing about you you
40:09
end up becoming a server you then have the option just this speaks to kind of the architecture on the internet imagine
40:14
if every individual had their own IP address and that individual's IP address uh had behind it behind your ability to
40:22
control lots of information and lots of output about all your interactions across the different networking service
40:28
providers that you use that's a very smart framework I think and that object and ultimately what you would agree you
40:34
want to be able to rent that data to services I don't even think it's about rent is yeah as much as it is about you
40:40
should have the reason the reason rent well that then you have to rent it you can't give it to them because that's be stupid that's right and so your goal
40:46
your usage like let's say the doctor says hey can I can I get access to your health data or sorry your your Apple
40:53
watch activity data for the last year you then have the option to provide that data to them through some permission
40:58
type service that you then make available so there will be interconnectivity amongst the service providers but entirely gated and
41:05
controlled by the user look you're seeing this up front now with Reddit when in this world the people that
41:12
create the content are actually in control of the data and if you try to like monetize an API without paying the
41:19
people that created it or giving them control they'll revolt and you're seeing it happen now Reddit lost what 90 some
41:25
odd X percent of all of their content because the mods were like you to Reddit well think of that writ large
41:31
where everybody is asked hey on this great service hey I'm this great service I can solve x y and z problem for you
41:37
just give me all your data and then if you're not asking well what do I get and they're like well you're going to get a
41:43
whizbank service and that's all they they say you're being tricked it's already happening I mean there's an open
41:48
source lawsuit against uh Microsoft's GitHub co-pilot and you have the Getty lawsuit and
41:55
you know it there's also a correlator for this Google tried to kill Expedia already they tried to kill Yelp and it
42:01
didn't work folks use both services and you know if you if you are trying to boil the ocean like chat gbt might I
42:08
think it's not going to work because there's going to be so much Innovation so much Community brand and all that kind of stuff and these llms seem to be
42:15
trending towards good enough or some kind of parody that I think your rights people are just not going to give their
42:21
data over wholesale I've been using the Zillow plug-in to get exact and the zoa plugin sucks on chat it's
42:28
getting slightly better well I guess it's the wrong model this will exist on Zillow site Zillow
42:35
will not let chat CPT take their business you're going to go to Zillow site and you're gonna say hey show me homes that have a sauna and a nice
42:42
plunge and that are four bedrooms and that are you know fixer-uppers or are not fixer-uppers and
42:47
have ensuite bathrooms and whatever and it's just going to give you that list why would they give that business to closed AI can you take a crack just at
42:54
summarizing what we all just said because your your initial question was Friedberg was like what does this mean
43:00
for Google well we all just said that what we're certain of is there's not going to be 10 Blue Links and a
43:07
model of search that they have monetized in a way that has been the most prolific business model in the history of
43:13
capitalism right so that's a problem for them you know from a business model perspective so they're going to have to
43:19
reinvent their business that's going to be hard to do it's like rebuilding the plane on the fly but that then if you just go to the two models that we
43:26
outlined here on the one hand shama said you know you're going to work with all of these agents that's exactly what Mark
43:31
Zuckerberg said on Lex he's like you're not going to have one super agent you're going to have you know hundreds of
43:36
agents and he he thinks of what's happened all of his platforms is the new open web where all of these agents will
43:42
live and you'll interact with them you'll interact with your Zillow agent there you'll interact with your booking agent your Expedia agent there Etc on
43:50
the other hand chat GPT Hyatt inflection read Hoffman and and Mustafa and many others think that the
43:58
benefits of general intelligence this will be the first time that that we solve vertical problems horizontally
44:05
right and their metaphor the compare there is we all don't have a hundred
44:11
personal assistance in our office you have one that gets to know you really well they get to know what you like to
44:17
wear how you like to travel the things you like to eat the things you like in your house how many kids you have so
44:23
there's real leverage in that in that horizontal knowledge that can then be
44:28
applied to these different verticals I think the answer lies in between your personal assistant will do a lot of the
44:34
general stuff okay whether it's Pi chat GPT whatever Googs comes up with Etc but
44:40
I think they will subcontract the work whether they chain it out via you know behind the the scene
44:47
you know mechanism to other agents so for example if you're interested in
44:52
traveling to this undisclosed location that I'm at in in Europe right now you
44:57
know my my my assistant doesn't know anything about this place so she may interact with a specialist
45:04
for this particular place to get you that magical experience so you know I I
45:10
don't think you have to pick one or the other but architecturally 20 trillion dollars of value on the web is built
45:17
around web pages advertising and e-commerce right and
45:24
sending traffic to those other places and what we're all saying unequivocally is it's moving to knowledge extraction
45:32
and intelligent agents and I think that's tectonics but I still think there'll be clicks I you know I
45:38
have been using Bard a whole bunch and they have made massive rapid progress just to give you but one example here
45:44
I'll share my screen it is pretty extraordinary how quickly they're figuring this out and I did this just to
45:50
the search while we're talking about the five best Greek restaurants uh in the Bay Area obviously came up with kokar and you know other ones and then I asked
45:58
it like hey what are the top items on each of these menus they started putting images in and linking to Yelp and then I
46:04
said hey tell me the most expensive wines and it actually got that from kokari they
46:10
have a chateau Margot 2009 for 1500 chamoth I don't think it's good enough for you but what year is it it looks
46:16
like 2009 yeah they have Screaming Eagle 2013. I don't know if that's a no-go Carl in 2014.
46:24
yeah but anyways okay okay good so we've got to save anyway
46:31
search like four weeks ago it didn't have images and it couldn't get me the items on the menus and these could all
46:37
be links and these could all be paid links so in these results there's nothing to stop Google from saying hey
46:43
Yelp if you want we'll put your information here or not up to you you choose do robots.txt except we're going
46:49
to call it ai.txt you tell us what you want to be included and if you want to be included we want you know it's it's a
46:56
Marketplace for clicks we'll include three of your images with clicks and we'll call it sponsored they are going to be able to insert ads into here that
47:02
are better than the current ads and that will perform at a higher level and they're going to know us this could actually be the reverse of what
47:08
everybody's thinking this could lead to higher cpms and higher costs per click because of intent by the way I mean the
47:15
the 2014 is actually I think uh underrated and it's very highly rated
47:20
but I think it is an excellent one all right Jason as to your point I think all of
47:26
that I mean that's impressive it's true you can also do it on chat GPT I'll just say the number of people I interact with
47:33
on a global basis who talk about chat GPT versus Bard is like ten to one today
47:39
now Google's not that's gonna change real fast Google's got massive distribution power let me tell you what
47:44
I what I also think but to your point Brad about this bro I just want to I want to respond to you Bard versus gpd4
47:50
that's people are not paying attention and when Google puts this on the home
47:55
page yeah and starts sending five percent of users to it I mean obviously it's expensive to do it people are going
48:01
to have their eyes jump out of their head I think Google's going to be Chachi pt4 I'm saying it right here right now I
48:07
think they're going to beat them because I think that they're better at indexing all this information and understanding it than anybody on the planet and they
48:13
have the the largest ad network if they get this done in the next six months I
48:18
think it's going to increase the cost per click because they're going to know so much about each user continue abroad
48:24
I know I'm in the minority here well uh no no I mean listen I think a lot of Google's revenue comes from de facto
48:30
navigation of the web they term they turn the URL into a navigation box there are a bunch of ads there that you know
48:36
people click on they don't even know they're clicking on ads and you know they generate a lot of Revenue off of
48:42
that but let's be clear Google is firing at this I just don't think it's going to
48:48
be as monopolistic as they are in search I think there are going to be other competitors who are going to be wealth
48:53
financed you're going to have access to the data um and today you have well north of 100
48:59
million people who are paying to you know a huge percentage of those to use
49:04
chat GPT and I think this you know it's the first competition but you know
49:10
Friedberg knows he and I had the back and forth they reported earnings stock was flat I said on CNBC that we had sold
49:17
our shares we bought back some of the shares around Google I O because we do think they're going to be a player we
49:23
think they're going to be a beneficiary but I I would say as I sit here today the distribution of potential for them
49:30
is less than it was before chat GPT you know the the distribution of of upside
49:38
they have some competitors now who are going to be vying for this next
49:43
new thing and I wonder whether or not you know as they try to navigate you know you're saying they're going to take
49:49
some of this traffic from search and feed it into this other thing this other thing better monetize as well as search
49:55
or by definition that means Revenue goes down it feels like Google is so close to figuring this out I mean I've been doing
50:02
some barge searches how much Google do you own how much Google is not enough not enough I've just been playing with
50:07
the J on my jtrading.com he's thinking of adding this stuff like a buy-in or two
50:15
but uh let's pivot over to this Reddit thing because it's super important that people understand this
50:22
I'm gonna buy 17 more shares I'm gonna buy like a Harlan 2014 equivalent insurance no my J training is up right
Jay Trading beating the market, how Brad formulates and sizes public bets, how GPs should handle distributions, CalPERS mistakes
50:29
now jtrading.com shout out uh to my trades I did it as for fun I'm at like 20 Returns versus six percent well you
50:36
were kind of quiet for a while so when you're down you don't talk to things I liked and I didn't want to
50:42
change them do you track them and exit or what do you do I'm gonna track the exits but I haven't exited any if you go
50:48
to jtrading.com you can play along how can you only be up 20
50:54
when Facebook has doubled oh sorry 22.43 yeah but Facebook doubled off the bottom
51:00
the whole goal of trading jcal is to maximize your highest conviction maximize your highest conviction what'd
51:06
you do put a nickel to put five percent into Facebook I don't know I just I just bought companies
51:16
you got to put a lot of chips on the table I mean that's I think what's the optical number as a day trader Brad
51:23
what's the optimal number of names I should have you're not a day trader you don't trade
51:28
as a long Trader what's the optimal number of names I should be uh you have too many
51:34
um I think with your level of insight um you know on the things that you really believe in there was such
51:41
asymmetry in that position at the time that you bought it it was your best idea you should have put at least 30 percent
51:47
of of whatever you're going to allocate to this internet position that's what I'll do yeah I mean it's done okay I
51:53
mean listen I'm up what did I buy I bought uh 500 shares and my basis is 47 I'm at 140. so it was
52:00
a good trade now imagine if you could you know 10 or 20 exit yeah that's what I should have done yeah all right Jason
52:05
how wait hold on how much have you put into all those stocks 1.5 million I I basically took I had some money in an
52:11
index fund laying around and I was like let me do this 5 million I did Jay trading as a blatant attempt to get a
52:17
sponsor for this weekend startups so I was like oh maybe Robinhood or E-Trade will sponsor this and I'll make it like
52:22
a segment oh my God let me do like a segment where I trade and see if I can secure the bag and it you know the
52:29
markets are so crushed that nobody is spending advertising from Robinhood or E-Trade or interactive brokers or
52:35
Bloomberg but I also did because I wanted to become better at Public Market trading to your point to last week's
52:40
Prime conversation per month is under understanding when to sell and when to go long when you get distributions as a
52:46
VC that was really the reason I tried to do it was just to try to have skin in the game you know just like learning to
52:52
play PLO or you playing the Razz tournament I just want it's it's very it's very easy once you get shares
52:58
distributed to you immediately sell them and then yeah and then hold on yeah and
53:03
then re-underwrite from scratch from there okay once the money is sitting in your
53:08
account even if it takes a day a week a month it's not like the Stock's going to rip and triple on you over the next 30 days
53:15
re-underwrite it from scratch and then see if you have that much conviction when you see the money in your bank
53:20
account um I like it I would just tell you guys the distributions you know there were a
53:27
lot of firms that rode you know a lot of these big names right all the way down
53:35
um you know they they got public but they didn't distribute much if any and it's really don't say the names but
53:42
what do they rhyme with I'll I'll start I'll start but yeah go ahead you go you go next you
53:49
pick one not doing it um Andreessen borrow its flounders Lund
53:58
look at Freeburg just dropped off I don't want to be associated with this conversation all right listen we all got
54:05
our asses kicked except for me Uber's up 67 this year oh come on come on let me
54:10
what what I was saying it's just Rockets what tends to happen
54:17
is things hit the bottom they bounce a little bit and people are so relieved
54:22
that they bounced a little bit did they immediately start Distributing because LPS are hammering them LPS are like why
54:30
did you not send us this you know snowflake when it was at 400 a share why
54:35
did you not send us this doordash why did you you know go through any name you know that you can think of but then
54:41
people compound the mistake I think that as soon as they get a little relief
54:47
boom it's out the door and then the thing doubles on them and I just think
54:52
you know part of the benefit of me having to get up every day 5 a.m deal
54:57
with public markets and think about long or short it's what we were talking about in the fall of 2021 around the table
55:03
before the poker games which is the public market is tilty it doesn't feel
55:09
good and that you know we stopped making Venture investments in October of 21. principally because of how we felt about
55:16
public markets at that point in time and so I think a discipline in fact I was meeting with a managing uh partner of a
55:23
very big Venture firm in Silicon Valley this week they just started about a year ago or six months ago doing Public
55:29
Market investing and they said it was incredibly valuable to how they think
55:34
about distributions and what they're doing in the Venture business that's what it's been for me I have now started to learn how these things are priced and
55:40
I just think it's great as a learning thing for me I have to make two decisions when to distribute to my LPS
55:45
which I just give them the shares the second I have them and let them make the decision but then it's also personally for me me do I want to hold it or do I
55:52
not I like your suggestions a nice punch up shamath of looking at the cash and then deciding if you want to react did you guys see this crazy thing from
55:58
Calpers where they were like yeah you know they were they were down like four I mean horrible Returns on the Venture
56:04
side and so their decision was to Double Down well they didn't have they took like a decade off from Venture the returns of
56:11
what they did invest in adventure were atrocious to be fair I don't know how the board has changed to Calpers but
56:17
Calpers brought in a new CIO an entire new team and so they can't be held
56:22
liable for you know that track record I did kind of see something on Twitter about I was shocked it would be very
56:28
difficult to manufacture that bad a track record if what I saw was accurate however I would say the team that is
56:36
there now the portfolio that they're putting together and doubling down where I think Venture is kind of at the bottom
56:43
or bottom third and oh this is the bottom you know I think bottom third I don't know bottom half you know listen
56:49
inventory you got to find three things you gotta find you know you don't want to invest all your money at the top so
56:55
you got to get the bot you know bottom third none of us can call the bottom but you know last year at the end of 22 we
57:01
were certainly in the bottom third evaluations then you want to be early in a major platform disrupt I think we all
57:08
agree we're early in a major platform disruptions probably the third of our careers
57:13
and then you want to back one of the best firms Best Brands in Silicon Valley like if you do like and people know who
57:18
those are if you do those three things you know simultaneously like he got a good shot at producing really incredible
57:24
vintage just to put some numbers on the Calpers thing so you can respond to its mouth America's public largest public pension Calpers that's the California's
57:31
manages some 444 billion in capital on behalf of California's 1.5 million state
57:37
school and public agency employees is leaning it to venture after years of
57:42
bringing down its VC exposure to one percent to a one percent Target the institution investor is now looking to
57:48
increase this allocation more than six-fold obviously six percent from 800 million to 5 billion
57:54
the financial times reported so thoughts on that Shabbat well I mean this is the moment there's a lot of venture firms
58:00
that are hard up for money and so they may have a shot they can get allocations now in order to get into
58:06
these funds the problem that they have to realize is they may be buying a bunch of toxic
58:11
assets or a bunch of toxic Partners in the sense that a lot of these people have been getting run over for the last
58:17
three or four years we don't know again we've said before most Venture investors
58:22
are probably unprepared for this shock because they've never lived through one there's
58:28
been a lot a lot of Junior monkey mucks that were hired because they were XYZ middle level exec at Rando company means
58:36
nothing so I don't know I think it's smart that they have I mean they have to be
58:41
thoughtful first of all how is it that the Calif like literally it's like
58:47
I know trillions of dollars being made in your backyard and some genius was like well the thing that's creating all
58:54
the wealth in the world which is in our backyard where we probably have the best pitch in order to get into these
59:00
alien just called Doug Leone and say hey oh my God give me the listed put money on those tenant call it a day
59:06
oh my God that's unbelievable that's unbelievably derelict that's unbelievably
59:12
sloppy and I will tell you I'm sorry that's it sorry let me just finish that's actually that's the best word to
59:18
use when you look back on a decision like that there's no numerical justification that one could have made in the 2000
59:24
teens to have made that decision except that that was an emotional decision and when you're running a half a
59:31
trillion dollar fund there is no room for emotion you should not be allowed there should be some so I think that
59:36
that shows a very hollowed out and at a minimum imbecilic risk
59:43
management infrastructure at Calpers that needs to get fixed so whether the allocation goes up or down if I was a
59:49
teacher and my money was being managed by them I'd say man these people I would want to understand how they're making
59:55
decisions because I don't I would want to see the investment memo that got them
1:00:01
to decide as an investment committee that one percent in the most important asset class that's in your backyard
1:00:07
that's making all the money in the world made any sense I just want to read that memo and see could I agree with that
1:00:14
um hold on then I would want to read the investment memo that says we're going to
1:00:20
change course and get back to five or six percent because if that process isn't fixed these decisions are just
1:00:25
going to be equally bad you're just going to compound bad on top of bad because again they clearly did a
1:00:31
terrible job and then on top of that they had horrible partner selection because the
1:00:37
people that they did invest in because the data is public have performed horribly
1:00:42
so what changes now all of a sudden right because if the best firms still don't want you in increasing it from 800
1:00:49
million to 5 billion just means you're going to lose 4.2 billion more than you would have otherwise at 800 million it
1:00:54
says here they made uh two bets they had bet on uh looks like light speed in the
1:01:00
last couple years Lightspeed and tpg so we'll see how those
1:01:05
goals but I do have some data on this because we've spent a lot of time
1:01:10
talking with them and as you know Jason we were just talking you know like talking to folks like mabala who I I yep
1:01:16
California is one of the largest Sovereign wealth funds in the world right this is not just a state this is
1:01:22
bigger than most countries right this is one of the biggest economies in the world I would say that what my
1:01:28
interactions with the new team have been very impressive and I will tell you they're not just looking at funds and
1:01:35
building a new portfolio I think they are thinking about doubling down at the right time and they're thinking about
1:01:41
thematic bets against super Cycles like AI to say let's allocate this much money
1:01:47
who are the three or four deep strategic Partnerships that we can have to drive you know return on that so I I think it
1:01:54
I I think they're on their way but I I agree with you they're The Sovereign wealth fund of the most prolific state
1:02:00
in the world and they should have outsized return it's not trailing with this I just want to point out uh one
1:02:06
thing here is the power of writing shamop you decided to write your annual letter a couple years ago Brad you also
1:02:11
uh will write a letter famously in the Facebook getting fit one or the meta getting fit one the power of writings
1:02:17
and I just did this for the launch run 4. and when you write a deal memo compared to doing a deck
1:02:24
the the questions you get are so qualitatively different and the people you attract are so different it is
1:02:31
extraordinary I am advising startups across the board to write really tight
1:02:36
deal memos because I write these we write these deal memos internally when we make an investment but man is it great for clarity of thought and for the
1:02:43
person on the other side to just stop and read a thousand words or two thousand words as opposed to go through
1:02:48
some stupid performative deck it's just so such a better process maybe you could
1:02:53
you both could speak to that or Friedberg I don't know if you're you've been writing deal memos but maybe for people who are listening or capital
1:02:58
allocators and Founders I've been writing for years why and what is the what is it what does it do for you yeah
1:03:04
well it allows you to actually find people who will critique things in a thoughtful
1:03:10
intelligent way it's hard to critique Dax because you use broken English you use fancy Graphics all of a sudden
1:03:16
somebody that's very good at like graphical layout can dupe somebody else and so you don't get to good outcomes
1:03:22
because this weird group think effect sets in when you look at decks so I'm not a fan
1:03:28
of decks I I use them but they need to be a companion to some sort of long-form narrative document and I just think it's
1:03:36
more useful you get people who can really think about what they agree about what they don't agree about it shows the
1:03:42
intellect of the person writing it quite honestly I just think it's a it's like a basic
1:03:48
skill that people should have it's a useful skill to teach people as well decks are very dangerous I think if
1:03:54
you're going to make decisions I would encourage you the bigger the decision a deck is insufficient it can be a
1:04:00
companion piece but it needs to be attached to long-form documents but the law firm documents don't need to be long
1:04:05
either two three four five pages but without it I think you're going to allow some really bad decisions to creep into some
1:04:11
good ones Freeburg any writing from you for deals
1:04:17
okay do you have uh he ran he doesn't want to talk about
Reddit moderators in revolt and how this issue might reshape the future of social apps
1:04:22
writing all right as everybody knows uh Reddit is on strike right now I should say the mods who run Reddit are on
1:04:27
strike 95 of reddits went dark they basically turned off new posts or they
1:04:33
just went private basically nobody could join nobody could see the content I believe is what that me means between
1:04:38
Monday and Wednesday and the reason they're doing this is because Reddit decided it would start
1:04:44
charging for its API so who gets impacted by using the API it turns out
1:04:49
apps we saw this at Twitter as well when Twitter started changing its pricing for its API and this means that some of the
1:04:57
really high-end Reddit apps would have to pay 20 million dollars a year for access
1:05:03
to read its data now they originally had said they were changing this pricing because they were going to train AI
1:05:09
models uh and they wanted anybody using that data I.E Google bard or chatgpt4
1:05:15
and closed AI they wanted them to pay for it and Steve Huffman was uh explained all this in a New York Times profile in April you can go search for
1:05:23
that Reddit wants to get paid for helping to teach big AI systems the largest app is called Apollo uh just so
1:05:29
you know if you're not into those Reddit really came out with their app really late this was a function of the
1:05:35
2005 to 2015 time frame back then Web 2.0 startups didn't have a lot of
1:05:41
capital so they let other people build on their apis and build apps some of those apps caught Steam and are actually better than the apps developed at least
1:05:49
for a while it was better than the Twitter app and the Reddit app so thoughts on this freeberg there's a
1:05:55
history here um is mimicked at both Facebook and Twitter both of whom had open apis that
1:06:03
provided access to third-party app developers to build tools on top of the platform by
1:06:09
accessing either user data or content off of the network and then making that available via some different product
1:06:17
function some different UI than the native tools allowed if you'll remember Facebook started to kill off its API and
1:06:24
in the process killed a number of these third-party app developers the most prominent of which was Zynga I think
1:06:30
this was around the 2012 time frame you guys know if I'm right on that I think it's right sounds right and you know we
1:06:35
saw the same thing happen in Twitter where if you guys remember in the early days a lot of users accessed tweets from
1:06:43
people that they followed through third-party apps and third-party apps all competed for the user and ultimately
1:06:50
Twitter's management team realized that having direct access to the user being able to control the UI the ux and not
1:06:57
just become a Data Network but to actually become a a service for users
1:07:02
made a similar sort of change so you know reddit's motivation around AI
1:07:07
training is an interesting one but it does speak to this idea that these social network companies social in the
1:07:13
sense that the users themselves are creating the value they're creating the content at both Facebook at Twitter and at
1:07:20
Reddit ultimately the company loses the value if that
1:07:26
data that content gets extracted and they can't monetize it or capture the value somehow and it's a lot different
1:07:33
you know every company ultimately wants to become a platform company meaning that they can offer multiple products or
1:07:39
services to users that sit on top of some you know Network they've created
1:07:44
and in the process create a network effect because more products more apps creates more users more users you know
1:07:50
it gets more more uh more apps and so on that works well in some contexts like an
1:07:56
Apple App Store context but in the context where there is a network unto itself like Facebook Twitter and Reddit
1:08:03
meaning that there is already a user Network that is generating value in the form of the content that's being
1:08:09
produced and consumed you don't necessarily gain anything by then building an app Network on top of it and
1:08:15
I think that's been one of the kind of key learnings that's repeated itself over and over with Twitter and Facebook
1:08:20
the thing about Reddit it's always been a community service if you guys remember like in 2014 2015 in Ellen Powell
1:08:27
stepped down after there was a Reddit Revolt she was the CEO at the time and she fired an employee at Reddit that ran
1:08:34
the Q a site for reddit's mods and their users and the network the community was super pissed off when this happened and
1:08:40
they all revolted and they were going to shut down the service and ultimately Ellen you know got removed from her role as CEO when this
1:08:48
happened so you know because so much of the value of Reddit isn't in the management team it's not in the work
1:08:54
that the software Engineers do that run the company it's not the the VCS or the shareholders the value of Reddit is
1:09:00
inherent in the community it's inherent in the individuals that build the content on that platform and that
1:09:05
Community has convened many times in the past at Reddit to change the rules to say this is what we want this community
1:09:11
to become and this is how we want this management team to operate and so it's a really uniquely positioned business
1:09:18
says a lot about how social networks in this kind of modern era are operating it really speaks to how much of the value
1:09:23
ultimately accrues to the shareholders in a business like this when the users themselves can step in and unionize and
1:09:29
say hey you know what we're not going to allow this much value to be pulled out of the network in this way we want this
1:09:34
to change so I think it'll it'll have a lasting effect in terms of investing in Social Network or social media type
1:09:40
businesses where the users are generating so much of the value and have the ability to kind of communicate with
1:09:45
one another and control where value ultimately Falls tremoth you were at Facebook I think when Zuckerberg
1:09:51
realized enabling a bunch of folks to use the API wasn't as good as controlling the user
1:09:57
experience having a uniform user experience and uh it got deprecated and I remember
1:10:03
Zynga and a bunch of other people had games and were sucking users off the platform there was a LinkedIn competitor
1:10:09
at one point that was growing at a credibly violent pace and I guess you all made a decision we don't want you
1:10:15
sucking our user base off the platform maybe you could expand on what the decisions were at Facebook at the time
1:10:20
that was one of the things I ran I think one of my teams was responsible for Facebook platform
1:10:26
yeah it was just a very clinical decision around Enterprise Value look the the thing with Reddit
1:10:32
is that it's a hot mess and in order to try to create Enterprise Value
1:10:39
they decided to really Leverage the mods so that there was some level of control
1:10:48
and that control was necessary so that they could basically sell ads that's how this thing moved in lockstep because the
1:10:54
minute that there was corporate Venture investors and other investors and a need
1:11:00
to generate Enterprise value and is it worth 2 billion or 5 billion or 10 billion whatever the number was that
1:11:05
they thought they were worth they had to make money right and Huffman was very straightforward about that and wanting
1:11:11
to go public in the whole nine yards but because it was such a hot mess the mods became this integral
1:11:18
part of the ecosystem so that they could actually drive reasonable Revenue
1:11:23
but then what happened was it also allowed them to basically take over
1:11:29
and I think that it was a pretty significant miscalculation because I
1:11:35
think that what they needed to do was really redefine the economics of how Revenue generation splits would work
1:11:42
before they could do all of this stuff to try to monetize the API so I think like they got the order of operations
1:11:47
wrong but I also think it's very fixable and I think that they have some very smart people around that table so as
1:11:54
long as they're again willing to be clinical and unemotional like we were they'll get to the right answer which is
1:11:59
give them a healthy rev share that's the future Freeburg you know what version of what Freiburg said is true the content
1:12:06
creators need to get paid you know why you know you see content creators now on YouTube making millions tens of millions
1:12:13
hundreds of millions in a few unique cases billions and then we are all content creators yet
1:12:19
most of us on these old Legacy platforms make nothing so that exch that exchange has to change
1:12:25
Brad any thoughts with this derail the IPL not on that but I mean I think you know you bring up this thing about meta
1:12:31
you know did anybody pay attention to you know such launching project 92 right
1:12:38
and project 92 is going to take on Twitter it's a text-based social network that's
1:12:44
going to pay creators and they're recording apparently Oprah Winfrey the Dalai Lama and all of their creators
1:12:51
that are already on their current sites are saying we will use this thing to
1:12:56
interact and we will compensate you and then on Lex Friedman's podcast he mentioned something about
1:13:02
um you know having been inspired a little bit by what was going on with blue sky so I'm super
1:13:10
intrigued you know you talked about it at this all hands meeting I think Chris Cox talked about it so it looks like
1:13:15
meta may be revisiting some of these things that they shelved a while back you know doesn't have any direct uh
1:13:22
implications on the Reddit front but I think there's a suggestion here
1:13:28
that it may be more about putting the control back in the hands of the user
1:13:33
from a data perspective and a monetization perspective that would be a pretty gangster move
1:13:39
you know and an interesting way to leverage the platform and I don't really hear anybody talking about it there's a
1:13:46
really easy solution here for rabbit those mods most of them do it for fame glory and
1:13:52
affiliation uh Community but if some number of them wanted to monetize their
1:13:58
activity there why not allow people to subscribe to subreddits and pay a membership fee and split it with the
1:14:04
mods that that seems like it would be a high scale move getting patreon you know
1:14:09
subscription services to let them make a little bit of money and then with these it's only three apps that are being
1:14:14
affected they should just either buy those apps and bring those teams internal or I think it's not or they
1:14:20
could split Revenue with those apps they could tell those apps that that's the key issue it's like it's like if you're going to try to monetize apis on user
1:14:26
generated content I think what's Happening Here is the internet is saying okay that's enough because we're going
1:14:32
to leak our activity someplace else where we can directly monetize it so that's the whole point I think in this
1:14:37
current version of the internet the value is going to go and again further further further erode away
1:14:44
from decentralized apps and more towards the individual people or in this case
1:14:50
these hubbed spokes these mods and not to the centralized organization that that has the housing the Reddit the
1:14:57
Facebook of the world so that's just the trend that's happening the Instagrams of the world and there's nothing wrong with that
1:15:02
YouTube as well it's just where the pendulum is swinging so I think that Reddit just has to
1:15:09
cut him a deal pretty easy to do speaking of AI
Funding landscape for AI startups is overheating: Mistral's $100M+ Seed round, importance of constraints, and more
1:15:14
funding there was a breaking news story just in the last 48 hours a startup
1:15:19
named mishro AI has raised a 105 million seed round they're calling it
1:15:26
should be at about a 240 million valuation according to reports one of the co-founders is a deep mind
1:15:33
researcher I guess people are saying this is insane because they haven't written any code yet and they've been working on the company for a couple of
1:15:40
years why these rounds are so big is I guess that you have to buy all these h100s and they're expensive and these
1:15:45
rigs are very expensive I mean you guys saw this that Nat Friedman basically published that he
1:15:53
spent 75 million dollars on a bunch of hardware and if you were one of his portfolio companies you could use it so
1:16:00
getting these h100s and a100s to train on seems to be a non-trivial task and so and they're very expensive even if you
1:16:06
can't get a hold of them so I think what we're talking about is basically that these rounds have to go
1:16:11
up my and because if you notice like the the post you had to raise the post so that it
1:16:18
wasn't so utterly deluded as to completely disincentivize the employees but let's be honest here nobody's
1:16:25
writing 105 million dollar heat check that 105 million is chopped up probably 10 Ways to Sunday so there's a bunch of
1:16:30
people putting in fives and tens and 15s in the round and they said it was massively oversubscribed yeah so I so
1:16:38
it's everybody taking a little teaser bet the problem with these teaser bets is they never hit in the way that you
1:16:44
think maybe you'll get your money back with all the dilution that's going to happen etc etc this is not the way to make money guys
1:16:51
I'm just going to be honest with you so whoever's putting money in thinking they know what the they're doing you might as well just light it on fire go
1:16:56
to Vegas and have some fun with it because you will make more you'll get more enjoyment from that than you will for making these kinds of Investments
1:17:02
what do you think that's dumb stupid stupid bat brilliant Pat by the
1:17:07
way this has nothing to do with the company when you're embedding four million in
1:17:13
105 million dollar rounded 240 plus you do not know what the you're doing that is not the job
1:17:19
so again Mr they're going to be a couple monster rounds I think announced next week like
1:17:25
that are gonna make this one look like kids play um so a lot more of this is coming
1:17:30
you're exactly right this is about buying h100s and compute everything
1:17:35
we're talking about right an essential ingredient is compute and it's a scarce resource my God these people that put
1:17:42
the money in the seed round should have just bought Nvidia buy some call options like you'd make more money well and
1:17:47
there's downside protection because Nvidia has a floor and by the way because in just in case Mistral doesn't
1:17:53
work Nvidia will sell those h100s to somebody else yeah they probably have the option I think you're right on these teaser
1:18:00
bets this is a power law business there's a massive pressure on Young
1:18:06
Junior Partners principals Within These firms to do something fire them it's not
1:18:13
just teaser bets what happens in these players they want to get the logos
1:18:18
because they need to explain sorry no actually no that's even worse the GP
1:18:24
that can't manage their principle should be fired right so I think I should those the young people
1:18:30
should shut the up okay be lucky you have a job learn the
1:18:35
craft it'll take you a decade and if you are proposing stupid bets like this again sizing matters again I'm not
1:18:42
talking about the company here I'm just saying when you make a five million dollar three million dollar deal memo
1:18:48
for 105 Million Dollar Round that is stupid okay and so if you're the
1:18:54
partnership that allows those kinds of things to leak through you don't know what you're doing
1:18:59
so at some point somebody should be held accountable for this and I guess what's going to happen is the returns of
1:19:04
Calpers are going to Cascade through everybody else thinking well at least I own some you know h100s for a minute so
1:19:10
let me see people I think this could you wanna take the other side of that no that's just an incredible team that's
1:19:15
going to do you know that this may turn out to be a fantastic bet or I don't know Lightspeed or whoever LED this
1:19:21
round let me let me say something different in in 1997-98 we had a similar
1:19:27
phenomenon everybody thought internet search was going to be huge there was massive fomo and chasing and everybody
1:19:34
scrambled to get a search logo Alta Vista info C lycos go plan it all
1:19:42
you know geocities just go through the lists you know that people were scrambling after and the truth of the
1:19:48
matter is almost all those companies went to zero even though you got a couple bets right you got the internet
1:19:54
right you got search right but you didn't have to invest a dollar in search until 2003 and you would have captured
1:20:01
98.99 do it again do it again now for social networking same thing do it again for social networking Brad say all the
1:20:08
names say all the names it's the same thing same thing and so you know when you when I look at it
1:20:15
today we have a huge anti-portfolio for AI it's painful we've said no to over 60
1:20:22
companies right we you know but when we look around
1:20:28
I see a lot of our competitors doing a lot of these deals maybe they're teaser bets I don't really
1:20:35
know the size they're putting into those companies but I suspect that if we believe this is as big as as it's going
1:20:41
to be and going to play out over decades then putting a bunch of really small bets in order to buy a network or buy
1:20:48
relationships or buy logos Etc I don't think it's going to work any better this time than it worked then around social
1:20:54
networking but to be clear there could be some people who lead these deals who help these companies build incredible
1:21:01
businesses and those will you know they're going to be some winners here I think there's time to participate in the
1:21:07
winners a lot of this is unknown and unknowable it will become more clear in
1:21:13
the one two three years ahead the problem is for the LPS like if you are the lp I am an LP in a bunch of venture
1:21:19
funds this stuff really turns my stomach because I'm like wow I am losing money every day when I see these things that's
1:21:25
why I get so emotional about this I think to myself if the GPS that I've given money to are doing these kinds of
1:21:32
deals I'm screwed at best maybe I'll get back 50 or 60 cents on the dollar and I
1:21:38
immediately start thinking to myself I really need to write this down and I'm re-underwriting that person and that organization because I'm wondering how
1:21:45
can you let these things happen because if you just look back in history you have to be really really negligent
1:21:52
to not learn that these things never work out the way that you think they are and especially these kinds of rounds and
1:21:58
this nominal ownership the inability to defend ownership it's just not a path to success I mean also if you think about
1:22:04
this tremath you know what company in recent history that got over funded actually use that money logically the
1:22:11
magic of Silicon Valley is the milestone-based funding system and we never use short-circuit that this money
1:22:17
becomes a huge distraction to Founders if they were to receive 10 million 25 million work for a year or two then
1:22:24
raise another 25 or 50 million they don't need to raise all this money at once this is like taking your ABC round
1:22:29
putting it all in 100 is distract Founders and then everybody coming for a salary says well you got 105 million in
1:22:36
the bank I want three million dollars I want five million dollars what's the best example guys of a huge financial
1:22:41
winner that raised these ginormous amounts of money pre-launch of our product there's no
1:22:47
product here what's the best example magic leap what is it oh oh of disasters that
1:22:54
actually oh no no what is the best example of a great company I'm putting great quotes that raise these kinds of
1:23:01
amounts so early in this like quibby
1:23:29
we needed a lot of money later but no it's five million sorry 500 000 safe at
1:23:34
five five posts there's a five million valuation for Uber and 1.25 I think wouldn't it here's another thing
1:23:40
everybody walks in they say well I have to raise this much money it's good this is a circular logic I
1:23:48
have to raise this money because I have to have all this compute and I say okay you got to train it you
1:23:54
know we want to have a vertically integrated model we want to train a model and say okay so there's a huge upfront cost and they're like but I
1:24:00
don't want to take a lot of dilution so I have to raise it at a really high price and so you say okay well um that's
1:24:08
a that's a challenge for you not necessarily a good thing for us and then they say oh and I if you ask the
1:24:14
question is this an ongoing expense they're like oh yeah we're gonna have to retrain like we're gonna have to continue to spend this money and I'm
1:24:20
like well so if if you're a software company for example and you say well
1:24:25
what's my cogs if all of a sudden you have an embedded cogs that's massive and
1:24:31
recurring right for your compute costs that we haven't had in the past then the
1:24:37
revenue on the other side of that's got to be a multiple of what a traditional software company might have in order to
1:24:43
get back to that set of Economics so I think there's this there's a scramble and understandably so
1:24:49
if you think the big win AGI or you know this autonomous agent that's going to
1:24:55
you know be the top of the next funnel that thing is going to be worth a lot but to me
1:25:02
those are lottery tickets at this at this stage can I tell you a little secret
1:25:07
here's a little secret when you put in a hundred million dollars into a startup to buy compute
1:25:15
you are not buying whiz-bang Next Generation IP you are subsidizing capex
1:25:23
and that is a job that many many other people do at a very low hurdle rate
1:25:31
and so it is a law of capitalism that it could be the most incredibly
1:25:37
Innovative company in the world but if you are offering money to them
1:25:43
to fulfill a low-yield thing you are just not going to make a lot of
1:25:48
money when you put money into a startup that
1:25:54
is their writing code to build groundbreaking IP you own something that's really real
1:26:01
but that's because 80 cents on the dollar is going to core critical r d in that point in time and then they raise a
1:26:08
lot of money at a lot less dilution when 80 cents on the dollar goes to sales and marketing then they raise a lot of even
1:26:14
more money at an even smaller smaller amount of delusion you start to get to scale internationally so you start to
1:26:19
see right more dollars less return right you're owning less of the critical
1:26:25
differentiation so if if everybody is like oh it's so expensive for compute I need to raise
1:26:31
100 million well buddy you know that's like a leasing function you know you're you're like all of a
1:26:38
sudden like the best VCS in the world have become like Comerica Bank yeah I mean they could have done it with the
1:26:44
same structure right Comerica could have given them 50 million to buy these machines and maybe they should and Comerica and JPMorgan and somebody else
1:26:50
should basically say hey you know what here's a lease line for your h100s because I know they're worth so much and I'll just yes write it at 10 percent
1:26:57
and and my point is that the fact that people don't understand this is why the money will get torched I would love a
1:27:04
critique that says actually tomoth you're an idiot I'm right I know that that's happening but here's why I still see it happening I don't hear any of
1:27:10
that here's the problem with that critique okay so you asked like what are the biggest projects in history you know
1:27:16
uh around startups think about AWS I don't know they spent 400 million probably uh in order to get AWS off the
1:27:22
ground but it wasn't done by a startup right you think about what zoc's spending on the metaverse it's not being
1:27:28
done right by a startup the truth of the matter is can you go back to apa AWS AWS
1:27:34
was dog food on Amazon retail of course of course and Oculus was done on Kickstarter like the cash flow of Amazon
1:27:41
retail fed the development of AWS correct my point is that when you think
1:27:47
about what these hyperscalers are going to do they're not going to spend a billion they're not going to spend 10 billion they'll spend a hundred billion
1:27:54
dollars right in order to be in this race and so if you're backing a startup that says I'm going to
1:28:01
build a better chat gbt right just like open AI discovered themselves they sold
1:28:06
51 or 50 percent of the company to Microsoft for a reason they had to they had to have the data
1:28:12
and they had to have the compute this is a nuclear arms race around compute and so but I think it's this is insane it's
1:28:20
financially illiterate for someone to think that they are actually doing anything other than subsidizing capex
1:28:26
when you're giving a hundred million dollars to a startup to literally buy chips and services you want to give up
1:28:33
40 of their Equity that's the other thing this Equity is so valuable why would you want to give 40 of it when you could get an equipment lease and keep it
1:28:40
twenty percent you probably can't get this you can't get them I mean if the VC's put in 50
1:28:45
million instead of 105 you don't think America would come on the back end with 25 million of course they would Brad is
1:28:51
right this happened in 98 99 2000 where all of this money was getting flushed
1:28:56
down the drain going into buying Data Center capacity where remember even at Facebook like we were racking and
1:29:01
stacking our own servers and then we then we ultimately got big enough where we actually built out our East Coast and
1:29:07
West Coast Data Centers and data centers all around the world but it was very expensive and in that moment again all
1:29:13
of those companies just lit all that money on fire it they torched it there was no Remnant Equity value for that
1:29:20
capital I guess I'm just I'm just questioning like what does a GP think they're
1:29:26
actually buying well 80 if 80 of it's going to Hardware I mean they're buying the other 20
1:29:33
buying chips I mean it doesn't make much sense that's going to get options I want
1:29:38
to make one point here and Freeburg I want to get your input on this as well it constraint is important for Founders
1:29:44
and the thing that I find really troubling about this is yeah and putting this startup aside because crypto people
1:29:50
also went through this for the last three or four years where they were over funded it was tens of billions of dollars burnt of LP
1:29:58
monies people's retirements and college endowments and it's going to be quite a postmortem but look at you you invoked
1:30:04
meta it's important for people who don't know this to know that that was a Kickstarter
1:30:10
shout out to Palmer lucky he raised a couple of million dollars in 2011 I think it was
1:30:17
on a Kickstarter pre-selling the devices right constraint makes for great art constraint makes for great startups you
1:30:24
need to have pressure on a startup for them to deliver you cannot give startups five years of Runway and expect it's
1:30:31
going to work it just doesn't work and I've seen this movie so many times but now we've gone through 18 months of nobody doing
1:30:38
anything I guess in VC land so folks on Saturday are itchy they want to justify
1:30:43
why they should still be drawing two percent on the full fund they want to try to show activities so that they can
1:30:49
raise the next fund and continue to stack fees and all of these sort of leads to these suspension of financial
1:30:56
logic but it gets replaced with financial illiteracy which is really there's an optimal fund size right and
1:31:01
this is why the people that pay the price are ultimately the LPS and it may be the case that Calpers maybe actually
1:31:07
avoids a lot of these pitfalls because by missing yeah they missed all the returns but then they missed writing the
1:31:13
mega follow-on checks for all of these folks that they and then they would have torched I'm gonna take the other side of
1:31:18
that go ahead Brad I think it's merely impossible to conceive that all of these bets that are currently being made are
1:31:25
bad bets I think it's a major platform disruption but I I you know instead I think the
1:31:31
right way to think about it is it's about pacing and if you're trying to if everybody thinks they're going to build
1:31:38
the next Google they're going to build the next autonomous agent that's going to sit on top of the funnel that's going
1:31:43
to be worth a trillion and therefore they can burn a billion dollars training models that's not like we're not going
1:31:49
to have 10 of those winners okay but at the same time there's a lot of
1:31:54
stuff getting funded that is in the application layer that is in the tool layer and these are not the big
1:32:00
headlines that you're reading about but these are really interesting businesses that are solving real problems in the
1:32:07
software and tooling layer here you know in the smaller model layer vertically oriented things around Life
1:32:14
Sciences or uh you know targeting you know Financial Services or things in the
1:32:20
application layer you know like character.ai Etc so I do think there are
1:32:26
a lot of good things getting funded that will deliver real value but I agree
1:32:31
with you the prop that there's a there's a second problem to this chamoth if you drop a billion or two billion or three
1:32:37
billion into something you have not only a a product challenge
1:32:42
you have a distribution challenge right we know all the hyperscalers are
1:32:48
going to play Google is going to play meta is going to play and so you've got to compete and then beat them and it
1:32:55
used to be that you would say well if I get a lot of traction they'll buy me if I'm Instagram or Whatsapp like they'll buy me well we have such a regulatory
1:33:03
nightmare in Washington DC today no hyperscaler can spend over a billion
1:33:09
dollars to buy any AI company not even that 400 million gift what is it giffy I
1:33:15
bet it wasn't even actually in the United Place mergers and acquisition
1:33:20
right with copy and compete because we've said to hyperscalers
1:33:25
you're not allowed to acquire any of these companies so the unintended consequence of the
1:33:32
regulation in Washington is that entrepreneurs and Founders and Venture capitalists who might otherwise have had
1:33:39
a good idea built something with some traction they can't find a home for it in the way you know that WhatsApp found
1:33:46
a home or is that a good thing Instagram isn't that a good thing go public and be independent is it
1:33:53
better presupposes that everything can become a big and profitable business there are a lot of net net can what is
1:34:00
it better for them or become a big and profitable business no on its own no chance
1:34:05
well it's still not a bigger problem so that's what I'm saying so maybe it should have died I mean maybe it's being
1:34:11
kept alive but I mean it's better don't you think it's better for the market I think it's created it was it was
1:34:17
Innovative technology it was yeah it you know you you were able to to back it with some good funding and I think
1:34:23
what's coming is going to be really exciting but it took a really long Runway a lot of capital A lot of
1:34:28
intelligence in order to build unfortunately we've killed that so you have a two-sided problem we're spending
1:34:34
more than ever to fund and start these companies and we you know have undermined a lot of the downside
1:34:40
protection Freeburg your thoughts so if you look at how the capital is being deployed if it's mostly being deployed
1:34:46
to train models then the question has to be is there really a sustainable advantage
1:34:52
that arises by being the first to train the models and then being able to
1:34:57
persist an advantage by training new models from that foundational model going forward and the reason that that
1:35:03
matters so much is because you have to really have a deep understanding if you're going to invest a lot of capital
1:35:09
here you have to have a deep understanding for how quickly model development and training is accelerating
1:35:15
and how quickly the costs are reducing so something that costs like we said open AI spent 400 million dollars
1:35:21
training models for for gpt4 if they spend 400 million dollars in the last couple of years
1:35:27
you could probably assume that doing the same trading exercise could be done for five to ten million dollars 18 months
1:35:34
from now to generate the same model that's a you know 100x cost production and I'm just ballparking it here but if
1:35:41
that's really where things are headed then does the 100 million dollars to
1:35:46
train models today really make sense if trading those same models can be done for five million dollars in 18 to 24
1:35:52
months great point and that's where it becomes a really difficult investment exercise and one that you have to really
1:35:57
critically understand how cost curves are moving in AI the same thing with true and DNA sequencing in the early
1:36:02
days and it's following by the way a similar cost curve is DNA sequencing which is actually greater than Moore's
1:36:08
Law greater than a 2X cost reduction every 18 months we're seeing something much greater than that in machine
1:36:14
learning right now in terms of cost reduction and model training so ultimately the business model has to
1:36:20
have some advantage that by being the first to Market you can then generate new data that gives you a persisting
1:36:26
advantage and no one can catch up with you and my guess is if you get under the hood of the business models you it's
1:36:31
unlikely going to be the case and it's very likely going to be the case that you don't know when the market Advantage will lie when
1:36:39
you will be able to kind of create a persisting mode a moat that expands as you get more data and can train more and
1:36:44
this is why it's so hard to invest generally in technology is because you don't know the point at which the market
1:36:50
tips relative to the point at which the technology tips so there's a moment where the technology gets so cheap and
1:36:57
then the market maybe adopts after the technology gets cheap and at that point it's a totally different game remember
1:37:02
in the mid 2000s where we had memory shortages and we used to have to buy Ram yeah I mean it's just like it's all this
1:37:09
stuff and it's like if VCS are funding this stuff just you just like like the equity on fire guys not going to be
1:37:15
worth anything Brad's point is Right which is the question is what's possible now where can you build a sustaining
1:37:21
Advantage now rather than go after big model development Cycles where the cost curve is going to come down by 100 fold
1:37:27
in some period of time in the near future is there a business model Advantage you can build by being in the market first
1:37:33
building a customer base accelerating your features getting user feedback and that certainly exists in the application
1:37:40
and the tools layer as Brad is talking about that seems like such a no-brainer for disruption across many different
1:37:46
segments many different verticals many different markets right now versus trying to compete further down
1:37:52
the stack where it takes hundreds of millions of dollars of capital and in a couple of months that hundred millions
1:37:57
of dollars of capital can be replaced with five million bucks of training exercise and compute can I take the other side of that yeah all that
1:38:03
coordination makes no money today so to your point when you cut the actual input cost by a hundredfold the coordination
1:38:10
cost goes from being zero to being worth less than zero right I don't see any money being made there either and all
1:38:16
the people that say I'm sure there's going to be some genius in the comments but what about open source it's like what about it open AI also just
1:38:24
gave an update on their cost structure for their API and they just dropped it 25 to 75 again this is after the tenfold
1:38:31
drop they did last year play this out a hundred million dollars of capital spent training today is a million dollars
1:38:37
spent doing trading in 18 years yeah three years 18 18 to 36 months somewhere
1:38:42
in that time frame likely the time frame so why would you spend all this money today when an 18 to 24 month things are
1:38:48
going to get so much cheaper yeah I think the further up the value stack you go the more of an opportunity to truly
1:38:53
kind of innovate disrupt and make well what on Capital as possible what happens in 24 months though when you've made a
1:38:59
bunch of 100 million dollar Investments and they're all zeros uh you uh get fired
1:39:07
maybe unfortunately as an investor chip up is that what you're asking at some point you don't get invited to
1:39:13
join the next fund think about the alternative investment strategy with lots of capital where the cost curve is
1:39:20
not coming down as quickly in terms of where that capital is being deployed for example building Rockets to go to space
1:39:25
or building uh infrastructure to transport power or building roads
1:39:31
you could raise a billion dollars to build a toll booth system or a port let's use a port a shipping Port is a
1:39:37
good example you could spend a billion dollars to build a shipping port it's not that the cost of building a
1:39:43
shipping Port is going to come down by 10x in 18 months so it makes sense to raise a billion dollars and build a
1:39:49
freaking shipping port and charge people right coming out VCS thought they were underwriting IP instead they're just
1:39:55
actually subsidizing catbacks it's the craziest thing Brad is this a problem of
1:40:01
the optimal Venture fund size that Fred Wilson talks about that bill Gurley talks about a lot of the ogs say hey 250
1:40:08
400 600 million there's an optimal size here for four or five Partners in a venture fund to put money to work is
1:40:15
this part of the problem right now which also happened in crypto is you had billion dollar two billion dollar funds
1:40:20
sitting around and and different Venture brand names having four or five of these multi-billion dollar funds burning a
1:40:27
hole in their pocket and getting frisky uh over this you know 18 month pause and
1:40:32
is this about optimal Fun Size uh making you know we have over a billion dollar
1:40:38
funds so if I if I if I take the other side of that the people are going to say you're talking your book but I don't
1:40:43
think this is about large funds I think this is about good and bad decisions at
1:40:49
the end of the day some of these decisions will pay off like for example what's the largest bet size from a
1:40:54
billion dollar fund that you've made or will make I think out of that fund would be a
1:41:00
hundred million dollars most likely but we may cross it over other funds and have you know bigger bets
1:41:07
um certainly would that happen two or three times though would you do it all at once like this or might it happen over you know series ABC kind of
1:41:14
situation where you build a position well I would say you know we're not writing I you know we haven't written a
1:41:19
hundred million dollar check into a series a and I don't think most of people to Chamas point that you're talking about are writing a 100 million
1:41:25
dollar checks into those series is the Mr all around it you reference I imagine the lead check into that was maybe 50
1:41:31
Maybe 50. so listen larger fund sizes enable you
1:41:38
to participate in companies that require more capital and and these companies do
1:41:43
require more Capital so you may take the position that all these companies are going to zero that's not my position
1:41:50
my position simply is that I do believe there is a bit of over exuberance that
1:41:57
too many things are getting funded right and it's um you know like the
1:42:03
margin of safety the margin of return being required is probably lower than it
1:42:09
should be but there's no doubt out of this vintage in my mind that you're going to have some epic companies now I
1:42:15
don't know if what Mustafa and Reed Hoffman are doing an inflection is you know building pie to take on chat
1:42:22
GPT and to take on bar to be the intelligent assistant the ambition is extraordinary the cost of compute is
1:42:30
high but the first mover Advantage is also high right because whoever secures
1:42:35
this position you know Bill Gates said he's been playing around with it it's one of his favorite agents or whatever that's an
1:42:42
interesting comment I think it's pretty good but I think chat GPT is out in front in this regard I think a lot of
1:42:48
people are going to try to compete for that space But you know I can't imagine that all these researchers leaving Deep
1:42:54
Mind right are going to be able to compete for the most sophisticated model to
1:43:00
answer general purpose questions so I don't think it's the large font size I think it's just a lot of exuberance to
1:43:06
participate in what everybody perceives to be a massive platform disruption I
1:43:11
think that can be true just like the internet was in 1997 and a lot of these
1:43:17
bets can you know can and will likely go to zero how great is America you just rent other people's money they pay you
1:43:23
two percent and then you're allowed to get exuberant yet keep your job when you lose it
1:43:28
God Bless America well I mean the the issue trim off is it takes 10 years to
1:43:34
prove you're bad at this job it takes 10 years to prove you're good
1:43:40
and it takes 20 to prove to prove that you can be consistently good and didn't get lucky but it in a few years you can
1:43:48
tell that somebody sucks can LPS tell well I'm not sure that they get the visibility because when LPS interact
1:43:55
with GPS they're grin for the most part so I don't know probably not but when I interact with them just as a
1:44:02
peer-to-peer level and I see the deals that get done it's pretty easy to understand that some people just suck
1:44:08
they don't know how to make money I guess is the point which in the job that's the job is to make money to
1:44:14
consistently make money okay Brad take care and uh let's go to science corner Bill Gates wants to genetically modify
Science corner: Understanding the Bill Gates-funded mosquito project in Colombia
1:44:21
mosquitoes is this fingers incorrect fake news it's fake news okay
1:44:28
explain the reference is from RFK Junior's tweet that he sent out where he
1:44:33
retweeted someone talking about this mosquito Factory in Colombia and this guy
1:44:41
basically put out a tweet saying oh look Bill Gates has a mosquito Factory in Colombia it's the largest in the world
1:44:46
30 million genetically modified mosquitoes are released every week into 11 countries because Bill knows better
1:44:52
than nature what could possibly go wrong RFK Jr then took it upon himself to retweet and say should Bill Gates be
1:44:59
releasing 30 million genetically modified mosquitoes into the wild part of the mentality of Earth as engineering
1:45:04
object what could possibly go wrong so I really wanted to take issue with this because I do think that this is the sort
1:45:11
of misinformation that both create scientific illiteracy
1:45:16
and damages and impacts negatively some of the significant progress that can be
1:45:22
made in medicine and in science so I want to speak very clearly as to what is going on what the science is behind it
1:45:28
why this is super important and then we can speak philosophically if you guys are interested on kind of
1:45:34
should we be doing this sort of stuff and why so what's real here like what what are actual facts versus fake news
1:45:39
maybe that's a good place to start the most common disease-carrying mosquitoes are called uh Edis uh egypti uh egyptia
1:45:48
um it's a species of mosquito that carry yellow fever a Dengue uh zika a number
1:45:54
of viruses that obviously are pretty adverse to human health each year about
1:46:00
400 million people are infected with Dengue virus via this mosquito Vector 100 million become ill and 21 000 deaths
1:46:08
are attributed to Dengue globally 200 000 cases of yellow fever each year causing thirty thousand deaths these are
1:46:15
pretty significant health concerns and it turns out that in mosquito populations not in this particular
1:46:20
species that carry these viruses but in other species of mosquito there's a bacteria a natural bacteria called
1:46:27
walbachia and this bacteria exists in nature and sometimes these mosquitoes get infected with this bacteria so they
1:46:33
carry this this bacterial bug and this bacteria is really interesting because it causes what's called
1:46:39
cytoplasmic instability in the mosquito cells which actually makes the mosquito largely resistant to a lot of viruses
1:46:46
and there's a bunch of theories for this mechanism and why this is the case but it causes the mosquito
1:46:52
to not be able to carry and spread these viruses that are super adverse to human health so number one there's a natural
1:46:58
bacteria that's found in nature and up to 40 percent of mosquitoes are already infected with it number two is it's not
1:47:05
common in the the mosquito species that is common in these areas that are spreading these awful viruses to humans
1:47:11
and so there's been a project that's been going on now for 12 plus years
1:47:17
where they're taking large amounts of mosquitoes and breeding them specifically to have this bacteria
1:47:23
in the mosquitoes and then they release those mosquitoes into the wild and over time the bacterial infected mosquitoes
1:47:29
start to become a larger percentage of the population and as a result the vector of carrying these awful viruses
1:47:35
into humans goes way down there was a study done in Indonesia where they took these walbachia infected
1:47:41
mosquitoes and they released them into the wild and they looked at a population that was in a region where they released
1:47:47
them in a population that they didn't in the release and region where they didn't release some 9.4 percent of people ended
1:47:53
up getting infected with dengue fever and where they did release them only 2.3
1:47:59
were infected so it was an amazing 75 reduction in the infection of people by
1:48:05
these mosquitoes and so the whole point is just to kind of you know move the mosquito populations in a way without
1:48:11
doing any sort of genetic modification but by exposing them to this bacteria so that they don't carry these viruses into
1:48:17
people but you know because Nuance point there Friedberg the it's not genetic
1:48:23
modification or it is it's not I just explained it's a bacteria mosquitoes they're exposing the so that
1:48:30
they end up getting infected with this bacteria and then as they breed the mosquitoes breed in this facility you
1:48:35
have you have to have two an infected male and an infected female for The Offspring to have the bacteria if you
1:48:41
have an infected male they're actually infertile they can only fertilize an infected female so unless you do this
1:48:48
breeding work you don't end up seeing this happen naturally in the environment where the wolbachia starts to spread where's the genetic modification
1:48:55
misinformation coming from them from from the the presidential candidate
1:49:00
RFK Jr who just propagated it and so this is why I want to make this point because this whole idea that oh should
1:49:06
we be engineering the Earth let me just say something about engineering the Earth humans used to wander around the earth
1:49:12
or proto-humans did without access to food and until we realized that we could plant a seed in the ground and grow
1:49:18
crops and started to engineer the Earth in the form of farming we did not have access to a reliable source of calories
1:49:24
human Ingenuity human engineering gave us the ability to do this gave us the ability to feed ourselves similarly
1:49:31
humans got infected by viruses by bacteria by Fungus and died at a young age over and over again and when humans
1:49:38
began to engineer medicine and engineer unnatural substances because he makes
1:49:44
this point oh should we be interfering in the natural world what is natural is for people to get infected with viruses
1:49:49
or bacteria and die and if not for the Advent of our engineering and our Ingenuity and our ability as a species
1:49:55
to create Solutions through science which allows us to do Discovery and then through engineering which allows us to
1:50:01
make solutions that solve problems that humans face we would all be dead at a young age and we would not have realized
1:50:07
the progress that we've had as a species so I really get ticked off when I see guys like RFK Jr and others not just
1:50:15
propagate this this BS misinformation spiel about oh genetically modified this
1:50:20
and that science is bad but to then say should we be messing with the natural world because I would say to him what
1:50:25
about when your kid got infected and you gave your kid antibiotics maybe you shouldn't have done that and this is a
1:50:31
group of people who are saying that you shouldn't do that right there is a movement to stop taking antibiotics because it's making
1:50:37
yeah because it's it's having it I'll tell you a couple things there are bad pesticides that impact human health and
1:50:45
cause damage to our DNA there is bad sunscreen that is endocrine disruptors and can damage human health there are
1:50:51
plenty of chemical products that are made that we use in everyday products that cause cancer there is an endless string of things
1:50:58
that are wrong with the system of engine the systems of engineering that we do use that doesn't mean that they're all
1:51:05
bad that doesn't mean that we then say hey you know what let's not do anything let's not do any engineering let's not
1:51:11
use any antibiotics let's not use anything in food and that's the challenge is you know getting into the
1:51:17
details on like I'll tell you I don't use any sunscreen products with myself or my kids I only use zinc and I have a
1:51:23
similar sort of nuanced approach to understanding what things we should or shouldn't use in our lives because of the data on the side can you please
1:51:31
explain that because I didn't know this but am I doing am I gonna what explain yeah so there's a number of substances
1:51:38
which are known endocrine disruptors that are found in sunscreen I think it's like one of the craziest things that we
1:51:44
haven't made these products illegal at this point but the only sunscreen that you should
1:51:50
use is natural mineral sunscreen uh this sorry I shouldn't say that you should I should say this is what I chose choose
1:51:55
to do based on the data that I've seen what's a good brand what brand any brand that sinks just zinc sunscreen just look
1:52:01
at the back if there's anything but zinc in it don't use it zinc oxide is that yeah
1:52:08
zinc oxide sunscreen yeah well that's the ingredient in it
1:52:15
so I don't know what you guys um huh wow but uh here let me just send you this but are you saying that you're
1:52:21
not allowed to have any other ingredient like there's no stabilizers there's nothing else no no that like it's it's
1:52:26
it's the principle ingredient has to be zinc oxide versus some other chemical you're saying
1:52:32
yeah so oxybenzone I don't use any product with oxybenzone that's like the most common sunscreen ingredient uh
1:52:38
octanoxate is the other one homothalate and the parabens all of those product categories which are the most common
1:52:45
products used in sunscreen they're absorbed by your skin they go into your bloodstream and their endocrine disruptors now the problem with the zinc
1:52:52
sunscreen and the mineral sunscreen is it actually stays on your skin so you look like you're wearing it's really hard to rub it in you got to really
1:52:58
really rub it in so they're actually not popular from a cosmetic point of view people don't like wearing them because
1:53:03
they look like idiots and it's really hard to yeah that's the stuff I use in the summer the isdin it drives me crazy
1:53:09
because I look like this weird ghost shiny ghost thing I know but I do use that that's like really hardcore about
1:53:16
that so that that's an example of understanding Nuance right it doesn't mean all sunscreens are bad
1:53:22
and it doesn't mean that we shouldn't use sunscreen but understanding what the risk factors are that are associated
1:53:27
with different ingredients or different engineering that's been done to make sunscreens available is important but that's so
1:53:34
many levels deep it's a really difficult thing so then people end up being scientifically illiterate and being wrong because someone like RFK Jr comes
1:53:40
along and says hey should we really be engineering the Earth with genetically modified mosquitoes and then people have this call to action shut those things
1:53:47
down shut those things down and they're incredibly beneficial and effective they're not taking any sort of genetic editing to Market they're not doing
1:53:53
anything that people might consider risky and we could have a separate conversation about the risks and benefits of of genome editing that's
1:54:00
another topic but how much of this Freiburg as we get ready to wrap here is
1:54:05
a reaction to what happened with covid-19 and people's fear now of and
1:54:11
getting sort of educated on gain of function research and you know this sort of recency effect of my Lord doing some
1:54:19
of the science feels like it's too dangerous certainly too dangerous to do inside a city and what's the point of taking bats out of caves and and doing
1:54:26
gain of function research how much of it has to do with that right now and it's a sort of the downside to questioning that
1:54:32
technology can can be asymmetric you can have like nuclear weapons can wipe out the world
1:54:39
they can wipe out the whole population yeah you know Talib makes this point on
1:54:44
his argument against GMOs which I would argue against him on this point but we could do that another time if he's
1:54:49
willing to come on I'd be super happy to debate him on this point but the idea being that there's super asymmetric
1:54:56
downside and so you know what happens is people see incremental improvements from technology
1:55:03
and they don't really praise those incremental improvements they assume that to be the case it's a linear step
1:55:09
function but when something goes wrong it's a big step down and then people are like oh wow and then people get scared
1:55:16
of technology and then people want to step away from it and this is true in anything that relates to your health to Food Systems
1:55:22
to the environment now um now it doesn't mean that all technology is bad or all engineering is bad but you know as mistakes are made in
1:55:29
the system as new things are discovered we have to retrench and change what we're doing but it doesn't mean that we
1:55:34
should stop progress and it doesn't mean that the whole system of humans figuring out how to engineer ourselves of the
1:55:39
world around us to benefit the health to benefit the planet to benefit other species on the planet isn't a critical Mission and
1:55:46
effort that we should be undertaking while the sunscreen thing is really tilting I mean I just I need to make sure I'm pretty sure we have a good one
1:55:53
but I don't yeah I'm on this right now this has got me a little nervous with my kids I I like these um
1:56:00
like I I have all my kids have long sleeve Sun shirts and I try to that's
1:56:05
what I am that I think is like the key thing and because I my family has skincare do I have to do that since I'm
1:56:12
dark skinned Freeburg [Music]
1:56:19
yeah you know it's a summertime you're in the bed you know you want to show up yeah you want to show off your typical stuff Revenge body I get it I get it
1:56:27
all right everybody on behalf of sacks let me just say Ukraine Ukraine
1:56:34
Ukraine body Biden and uh Francis mayor Francis
1:56:39
is now in the race so I guess we'll have him on the Pod we already talked to him oh okay so uh yeah at the summit last
1:56:47
year and also we're doing a survey for the podcast all in podcast dot Co slash
1:56:52
survey all in podcast dot Co slash s-u-r-v-e-y if you got to this point in
1:56:58
the podcast please fill out our survey our listener survey and we will see you all next time on the
1:57:04
all-in podcast we'll let your winners ride
1:57:12
[Music]
1:57:17
and they've just gone crazy [Music]
1:57:24
besties [Music]
1:57:42
it's like this like sexual tension that they just need to release [Music]
1:57:57
[Music] I'm going all in
